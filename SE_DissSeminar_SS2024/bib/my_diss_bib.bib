abstract = {Background The observed increase in the effects on human beings of weather-related disasters has been largely attributed to the rise in population exposed, with a possible influence of global warming. Yet, future risks of weather-related hazards on human lives in view of climate and demographic changes have not been comprehensively investigated. Methods We assessed the risk of weather-related hazards to the European population in terms of annual numbers of deaths in 30 year intervals relative to the reference period (1981–2010) up to the year 2100 (2011–40, 2041–70, and 2071–100) by combining disaster records with high-resolution hazard and demographic projections in a prognostic modelling framework. We focused on the hazards with the greatest impacts—heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods, and windstorms—and evaluated their spatial and temporal variations in intensity and frequency under a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions. We modelled long-term demographic dynamics through a territorial modelling platform to represent the evolution of human exposure under a corresponding middle-of-the-road socioeconomic scenario. We appraised human vulnerability to weather extremes on the basis of more than 2300 records collected from disaster databases during the reference period and assumed it to be static under a scenario of no adaptation. Findings We found that weather-related disasters could affect about two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 (351 million people exposed per year [uncertainty range 126 million to 523 million] during the period 2071–100) compared with 5{\%} during the reference period (1981–2010; 25 million people exposed per year). About 50 times the number of fatalities occurring annually during the reference period (3000 deaths) could occur by the year 2100 (152 000 deaths [80 500–239 800]). Future effects show a prominent latitudinal gradient, increasing towards southern Europe, where the premature mortality rate due to weather extremes (about 700 annual fatalities per million inhabitants [482–957] during the period 2071–100 vs 11 during the reference period) could become the greatest environmental risk factor. The projected changes are dominated by global warming (accounting for more than 90{\%} of the rise in risk to human beings), mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2700 heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period vs 151 500 [80 100–239 000] during the period 2071–100). Interpretation Global warming could result in rapidly rising costs of weather-related hazards to human beings in Europe unless adequate adaptation measures are taken. Our results could aid in prioritisation of regional investments to address the unequal burden of effects on human beings of weather-related hazards and differences in adaptation capacities.

For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4-7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n\,=\,309 cases) and estimated that 19\% (95\% confidence interval, 15-24\%) of cases seeded 80\% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P\,=\,0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P\,=\,0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95\% CI, 1.9-107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

  abstract = {Pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia and invasive disease, are major sources of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prevention of the first acquisition of Streptococcus pneumoniae through the use of vaccines represents an effective method to reduce the burden of the disease in both children and adults. Two vaccines are currently available in adults: a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) that includes 23 purified capsular polysaccharide antigens and a pneumococcal protein-conjugate vaccine (PCV13) that includes capsular polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to a non-toxic protein. The PPV23 induces a humoral immune response and since it has been licensed has been the subject of debates and controversies. Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that PPV23 protects against invasive pneumococcal disease, although there are conflicting data regarding its efficacy for the prevention of pneumonia. Vaccination with PCV13 stimulates good antibody responses as well as mucosal immunity and suppresses colonization. A conjugate vaccine can be expected to have benefits over a polysaccharide vaccine because of the characteristics of a T-cell-dependent response in terms of affinity, maturation of antibodies with repeated exposure, induction of immunological memory and long-lasting immunity. PCV13 has demonstrated all of these characteristics in children and fundamental differences in adults are not expected. The efficacy in adults is currently being investigated and results will be available soon.},

The hypothesis was that PCR is more sensitive than culture and would detect more cases of pneumococcal meningitis, particularly in children treated with antimicrobials before CSF sampling occurred. Patients younger than 16 years who had a CSF sample tested for S.pneumoniae DNA by PCR between 2004 and 2015 were included. A total of 2,025 samples were included, and the PCR had a sensitivity of 100\% and specificity of 98\% for the detected of S.pneumoniae DNA in comparison with culture. Of the 28 culture negative/PCR positive cases, 25 (89\%) were probable meningitis cases and only three (11\%) were suspected false positive results. Nineteen (76\%) of the 25 probable cases required ICU admission and three died (12\%). Six different serotypes were found in the culture positive patients (18C, 6B, 14, 22F, 7F and 33F). This study demonstrates that PCR testing of CSF samples for S. pneumoniae is sensitive and specific when compared with culture. PCR is particularly useful in detecting those cases where culture is negative, perhaps relating to pre-CSF sampling administration of antimicrobials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent increase in whooping cough incidence (primarily caused by Bordetella pertussis) presents a challenge to both public health practitioners and scientists trying to understand the mechanisms behind its resurgence. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the resurgence: 1) waning of protective immunity from vaccination or natural infection over time, 2) evolution of B. pertussis to escape protective immunity, and 3) low vaccine coverage. Recent studies have suggested a fourth mechanism: asymptomatic transmission from individuals vaccinated with the currently used acellular B. pertussis vaccines.
METHODS: Using wavelet analyses of B. pertussis incidence in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) and a phylodynamic analysis of 36 clinical B. pertussis isolates from the US, we find evidence in support of asymptomatic transmission of B. pertussis. Next, we examine the clinical, public health, and epidemiological consequences of asymptomatic B. pertussis transmission using a mathematical model.
RESULTS: We find that: 1) the timing of changes in age-specific attack rates observed in the US and UK are consistent with asymptomatic transmission; 2) the phylodynamic analysis of the US sequences indicates more genetic diversity in the overall bacterial population than would be suggested by the observed number of infections, a pattern expected with asymptomatic transmission; 3) asymptomatic infections can bias assessments of vaccine efficacy based on observations of B. pertussis-free weeks; 4) asymptomatic transmission can account for the observed increase in B. pertussis incidence; and 5) vaccinating individuals in close contact with infants too young to receive the vaccine ("cocooning" unvaccinated children) may be ineffective.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a clear role for the previously suggested mechanisms still exists, asymptomatic transmission is the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observations surrounding the resurgence of B. pertussis in the US and UK. These results have important implications for B. pertussis vaccination policy and present a complicated scenario for achieving herd immunity and B. pertussis eradication.},

The impact of the PCV-10 on rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) at the population level was not yet evaluated. Serotype-specific IPD changes after PCV-10 introduction is still to be determined. Data from national surveillance system for notifiable diseases (SINAN) and national reference laboratory for S. pneumoniae in Brazil (IAL) were linked to enhance case ascertainment of IPD. An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted to predict trends in the postvaccination IPD rates in the absence of PCV-10 vaccination, taking into consideration seasonality and secular trends. PCVs serotype-specific distribution were assessed before (2008-2009) and after (2011-2013) the introduction of PCV-10 in the immunization program. A total of 9,827 IPD cases were identified from 2008-2013 when combining SINAN and IAL databases. Overall, PCV-10 types decreased by 41.3\% after PCV-10 vaccination period, mostly in children aged 2-23 months, while additional PCV-13 serotypes increased by 62.8\% mainly in children under 5-year of age. For children aged 2-23 months, targeted by the immunization program, we observed a 44.2\% (95\%CI, 15.8-72.5\%) reduction in IPD rates. In contrast, significant increase in IPD rates were observed for adults aged 18-39 y (18.9\%, 95\%CI 1.1-36.7\%), 40-64 y (52.5\%, 95\%CI 24.8-80.3\%), and elderly ≥ 65 y (79.3\%, 95\%CI 62.1-96.5\%). This is the first report of a time-series analysis for PCV impact in IPD conducted at national level data in a developing country. We were able to show significant impact of PCV-10 on IPD for age groups targeted by vaccination in Brazil, 3 y after its introduction. No impact on other age groups was demonstrated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efficacy of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was inferred before licensure from an aggregate correlate of protection established for the seven-valent vaccine (PCV7). We did a postlicensure assessment of serotype-specific vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to derive the correlates of protection for individual serotypes.
METHODS: We assessed vaccine effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease using the indirect cohort method. We measured serotype-specific IgG concentration in infants after they were given two priming doses of PCV7 (n=126) or PCV13 (n=237) and opsonophagocytic antibody titre from a subset of these infants (n=100). We derived correlates of protection by relating percentage protection to a threshold antibody concentration achieved by an equivalent percentage of infants. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate vaccine effectiveness and reverse cumulative distribution curves to estimate correlates of protection.
FINDINGS: For the 706 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease included in the study, PCV13 vaccine effectiveness after two doses before age 12 months or one dose from 12 months was 75\% (95\% CI 58-84). Vaccine effectiveness was 90\% (34-98) for the PCV7 serotypes and 73\% (55-84) for the six additional serotypes included in PCV13. Protection was shown for four of the six additional PCV13 serotypes (vaccine effectiveness for serotype 3 was not significant and no cases of serotype 5 infection occurred during the observation period). The vaccine effectiveness for PCV13 and PCV7 was lower than predicted by the aggregate correlate of protection of 0·35 μg/mL used during licensing. Calculated serotype-specific correlates of protection were higher than 0·35 μg/mL for serotypes 1, 3, 7F, 19A, 19F, and lower than 0·35 μg/mL for serotypes 6A, 6B, 18C, and 23F. Opsonophagocytic antibody titres of 1 in 8 or higher did not predict protection.
INTERPRETATION: PCV13 provides significant protection for most of the vaccine serotypes. Although use of the aggregate correlate of protection of 0·35 μg/mL has enabled the licensing of effective new PCVs, serotype-specific correlates of protection vary widely. The relation between IgG concentration after priming and long-term protection needs to be better understood.

  abstract = {Background Routine immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7/10/13) has reduced invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to vaccine serotypes significantly. However, an increase in disease due to non-vaccine types, or serotype replacement, has been observed. Serotypes’ individual contributions to IPD play a critical role in determining the overall effects of PCVs. This study examines the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in children to identify leading serotypes associated with IPD post-PCV introduction.   Methods A systematic search was performed to identify studies and surveillance reports (published between 2000 and December 2015) of pneumococcal serotypes causing childhood IPD post-PCV introduction. Serotype data were differentiated based on the PCV administered during the study period: PCV7 or higher valent PCVs (PCV10 or PCV13). Meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the proportional contributions of the most frequent serotypes in childhood IPD in each period.   Results We identified 68 studies reporting serotype data among IPD cases in children. We analysed data from 38 studies (14 countries) where PCV7 was administered and 20 (24 countries) where PCV10 or PCV13 have been introduced. Studies reported early and late periods of PCV7 administration (range: 2001∓13). In these settings, serotype 19A was the most predominant cause of childhood IPD, accounting for 21.8\% (95\%CI 18.6∓25.6) of cases. In countries that have introduced higher valent PCVs, study periods were largely representative of the transition and early years of PCV10 or PCV13. In these studies, the overall serotype-specific contribution of 19A was lower (14.2\% 95\%CI 11.1∓18.3). Overall, non-PCV13 serotypes contributed to 42.2\% (95\%CI 36.1∓49.5\%) of childhood IPD cases. However, regional differences were noted (57.8\% in North America, 71.9\% in Europe, 45.9\% in Western Pacific, 28.5\% in Latin America, 42.7\% in one African country, and 9.2\% in one Eastern Mediterranean country). Predominant non-PCV13 serotypes overall were 22F, 12F, 33F, 24F, 15C, 15B, 23B, 10A, and 38 (descending order), but their rank order varied by region.   Conclusion Childhood IPD is associated with a wide number of serotypes. In the early years after introduction of higher valent PCVs, non-PCV13 types caused a considerable proportion of childhood IPD. Serotype data, particularly from resource-limited countries with high burden of IPD, are needed to assess the importance of serotypes in different settings. The geographic diversity of pneumococcal serotypes highlights the importance of continued surveillance to guide vaccine design and recommendations.},

  abstract = {The number of HIV-infected people is an important measure of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil and allows for comparison with epidemic patterns in other countries. This quantity can be estimated from the number of reported AIDS cases, which in turn needs to be corrected for the distribution of reporting delays and under-recording of cases. These distributions are unknown and must also be estimated from the recorded dates, which were missed to the Brazilian National AIDS registry. This paper estimates the number of AIDS cases diagnosed by inputting the lost information based on an estimate of the pattern in registration delay until 1996. We first fitted a non-stationary bivariate Poisson regression model to estimate the pattern in reporting delay. In the subsequent steps these models were applied to input new data, thus replacing the missing information, and to estimate the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic in the country. Model estimates ranged from 36,000 to 50,000 AIDS cases diagnosed in Brazil and still unreported. Therefore, the epidemic was 20 to 30\% greater than known from the available information as of February 1999. To be useful to health policy-makers, the surveillance system based on officially reported AIDS cases must be continuously improved.},

METHODS: Retrospective comparison of a Gram stain POC system to all high-risk patients (2008-2009) with only those with urogenital symptoms (2010-2011) on diagnostic accuracy, loss to follow-up, presumptively and correctly treated infections and diagnostic costs. Culture was the reference diagnostic method. RESULTS: In men the sensitivity of the Gram stain was 95.9\% (95\% CI 93.1\% to 97.8\%) in 2008-2009 and 95.4\% (95\% CI 93.7\% to 96.8\%) in 2010-2011, and in women the sensitivity was 32.0\% (95\% CI 19.5\% to 46.7\%) and 23.1\% (95\% CI 16.1\% to 31.3\%), respectively. In both periods the overall specificity was high (99.9\% (95\% CI 99.8\% to 100\%) and 99.8\% (95\% CI 99.7\% to 99.9\%), respectively). The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) before and after 2010 were also high: PPV 97.0\% (95\% CI 94.5\% to 98.5\%) and 97.7\% (95\% CI 96.3\% to 98.6\%), respectively; NPV 99.6\% (95\% CI 99.4\% to 99.7\%) and 98.8\% (95\% CI 98.5\% to 99.0\%), respectively. There were no differences between the two time periods in loss to follow-up (7.1\% vs 7.0\%). Offering Gram stains only to symptomatic high-risk patients as opposed to all high-risk patients saved €2.34 per correctly managed consultation (a reduction of 7.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of the Gram stain is high in men but low in women. When offered only to high-risk patients with urogenital symptoms, the cost per correctly managed consultation is reduced by 7.7\% without a significant difference in accuracy and loss to follow-up.},

Expert opinion: Despite the good results, several EU countries are going through unprecedented outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases due to insufficient coverage. The increase of vaccine hesitancy has made it difficult to reach and maintain high rates of vaccination coverage. Enforcing mandatory vaccinations is one of the strategies adopted by some countries, like Italy and France, to increase coverage. However, each country should find the most suitable way to keep up with vaccination coverages according to own cultural and organizational background.},

Starting in November 2010, PCV13 gradually replaced PCV7.
AIM: To report the impact of PCV7/PCV13 sequential introduction on IPD in Israeli children {$<$}5 years.
METHODS: An ongoing nationwide, prospective, population-based, active surveillance. All IPD episodes (Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid) from July 2004 through June 2013 were included.
RESULTS: Overall, 2670 IPD episodes were recorded. Incidence of IPD caused by PCV7+6A serotypes during the PCV13 period vs. pre-PCV period decreased by 95\% (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR]=0.05; 95\% CI=0.03-0.09). This reduction was observed in a two-step manner: 90\% in the PCV7-period and further 5\% in the PCV13-period. The rates of IPD caused by the 5 additional PCV13-serotypes (1, 3, 5, 7F, 19A; 5VT) increased initially by 47\%, but subsequently decreased by 79\%, resulting in an overall 70\% reduction during the entire study period (IRR=0.30; 0.21-0.44). A two-fold increase in non-PCV13 serotypes IPD was observed (IRR=2.43; 1.73-3.66). In total, a 63\% reduction of all-serotype IPD episodes was observed in children {$<$}5 years (69\% and 48\% in children {$<$}2 and 2-4 years old, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: After initiation of PCV NIP, a rapid and substantial 2-step IPD reduction was observed in children {$<$}5 years. The serotype-specific rate reduction reflected the sequential introduction of PCV7/PCV13.},

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

Unattached males also come to the beach, crowd around the nesting couples and compete with attached males for fertilizations. Satellite males form large groups around some couples while ignoring others, resulting in a nonrandom distribution that cannot be explained by local environmental conditions or habitat selection. In experimental manipulations, pairs that had satellites regained them after they had been removed whereas pairs with no satellites continued nesting alone, which means that satellites were not simply accumulating around the pairs that had been on the beach the longest. Manipulations also revealed that satellites were not just copying the behaviour of other males. Based on the evidence from observations and experiments, the most likely explanation for the nonrandom distribution of satellite males among nesting pairs is that unattached males are preferentially attracted to some females over others. Females with many satellites were larger and in better condition, but did not lay more eggs, than females with few or no satellites.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics of infectious disease can assist in the design of countermeasures and increase public awareness and preparedness. This article describes two main contributions we made recently toward this goal: a novel approach to probabilistic modeling of surveillance time series based on “delta densities”, and an optimization scheme for combining output from multiple forecasting methods into an adaptively weighted ensemble. Delta densities describe the probability distribution of the change between one observation and the next, conditioned on available data; chaining together nonparametric estimates of these distributions yields a model for an entire trajectory. Corresponding distributional forecasts cover more observed events than alternatives that treat the whole season as a unit, and improve upon multiple evaluation metrics when extracting key targets of interest to public health officials. Adaptively weighted ensembles integrate the results of multiple forecasting methods, such as delta density, using weights that can change from situation to situation. We treat selection of optimal weightings across forecasting methods as a separate estimation task, and describe an estimation procedure based on optimizing cross-validation performance. We consider some details of the data generation process, including data revisions and holiday effects, both in the construction of these forecasting methods and when performing retrospective evaluation. The delta density method and an adaptively weighted ensemble of other forecasting methods each improve significantly on the next best ensemble component when applied separately, and achieve even better cross-validated performance when used in conjunction. We submitted real-time forecasts based on these contributions as part of CDC’s 2015/2016 FluSight Collaborative Comparison. Among the fourteen submissions that season, this system was ranked by CDC as the most accurate.},

  abstract = {Bordetella pertussis infection remains an important public health problem worldwide despite decades of routine vaccination. A key indicator of the impact of vaccination programmes is the inter-epidemic period, which is expected to increase with vaccine uptake if there is significant herd immunity. Based on empirical data from 64 countries across the five continents over the past 30–70 years, we document the observed relationship between the average inter-epidemic period, birth rate and vaccine coverage. We then use a mathematical model to explore the range of scenarios for duration of immunity and transmission resulting from repeat infections that are consistent with empirical evidence. Estimates of pertussis periodicity ranged between 2 and 4.6 years, with a strong association with susceptible recruitment rate, defined as birth rate × (1 − vaccine coverage). Periodicity increased by 1.27 years on average after the introduction of national vaccination programmes (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.41 years), indicative of increased herd immunity. Mathematical models suggest that the observed patterns of pertussis periodicity are equally consistent with loss of immunity that is not as rapid as currently thought, or with negligible transmission generated by repeat infections. We conclude that both vaccine coverage and birth rate drive pertussis periodicity globally and that vaccination induces strong herd immunity effects. A better understanding of the role of repeat infections in pertussis transmission is critical to refine existing control strategies.},

The summary attributable risk for multiple factors can be estimated, with or without adjustment for other (confounding) risk factors. The relation of this approach to procedures in the literature is discussed. Given values of the relative risks for various combinations of factors, all that is required is the distribution of these factors among the cases only. The required information can often be estimated solely from case-control data, and in some situations relative risk estimates from one population can be applied to calculation of attributable risk for another population. The authors emphasize the benefits to be obtained from logistic regression models, so that risks need not be estimated separately in a large number of strata, some of which may contain inadequate numbers of individuals. This approach allows incorporation of important interactions between factors, but does not require that all possible interactions be included. The approach is illustrated with data on four risk factors from a pair-matched case-control study of participants in a multicenter breast cancer screening project.},

  abstract = {We wrote this book to introduce graduate students and research workers in various scienti?c disciplines to the use of information-theoretic approaches in the analysis of empirical data. These methods allow the data-based selection of a “best” model and a ranking and weighting of the remaining models in a pre-de?ned set. Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) licensure was conducted in order to analyze the impact of PCV13 introduction for children on adult IPD. A total of 1558 IPD episodes were detected. The incidence of IPD decreased significantly in the second period by -33.9\% (95\% CI, -40.3\% to -26.8\%). IPD due to PCV7 serotypes (-52.7\%; 95\% CI, -64.2\% to -37.5\%) and to PCV13 additional serotypes (-55.0\% 95\% CI, -62.0\% to -46.7\%) significantly decreased whereas IPD due to non-PCV13 serotypes remained stable (1.0\% 95\% CI, -12.9\% to 17.2\%). IPD due to all PCV13 additional serotypes significantly declined with the exception of serotype 3 (-11.3\%; 95\%CI -35.0\% to 21.1\%). IPD due to two non-PCV13 serotypes varied: serotype 6C that rose (301.6\%; 95\%CI, 92.7\% to 733.3\%, p{$<$}0.001), related to the expansion of ST3866C, and serotype 8 that decreased (-34.9\%, 95\%CI, -57.1 to -1.2, p = 0.049), related to a decline of the ST638. The recombinant clone ST652111A (variant of ST1569V) increased in frequency. The decrease of serotype 19A IPD was linked to a fall in those antibiotic susceptible clones. In the last period, rates of penicillin- and cefotaxime-resistance remained under 10\% and 4\%, respectively. Adult IPD decreased after the PCV13 introduction in Spain due to herd protection. The spread of multidrug resistant clones (ST3866C, ST652111A) related to non-PCV13 serotypes needs further surveillance.},

Initially controlled by mass vaccination, pertussis resurgence has occurred in some countries with well-established vaccination programs, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Several studies have used mathematical models to investigate drivers of pertussis epidemiology and predict the likely impact of different vaccination strategies. We reviewed a number of these models to evaluate their suitability to answer questions of public health importance regarding optimal vaccine scheduling. We critically discuss the approaches adopted and the impact of chosen model structures and assumptions on study conclusions. Common limitations were a lack of contemporary, population relevant data for parameterization and a limited understanding of the relationship between infection and disease. We make recommendations for future model development and suggest epidemiologic data collections that would facilitate efforts to reduce uncertainty and improve the robustness of model-derived conclusions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We assessed prevalences of seven sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Peru, stratified by risk behaviours, to help to define care and prevention priorities. METHODS: In a 2002 household-based survey of the general population, we enrolled randomly selected 18-29-year-old residents of 24 cities with populations greater than 50 000 people. We then surveyed female sex workers (FSWs) in these cities. We gathered data for sexual behaviour; vaginal specimens or urine for nucleic acid amplification tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; and blood for serological tests for syphilis, HIV, and (in subsamples) herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) and human T-lymphotropic virus. This study is a registered component of the PREVEN trial, number ISRCTN43722548. FINDINGS: 15 261 individuals from the general population and 4485 FSWs agreed to participate in our survey. Overall prevalence of infection with HSV2, weighted for city size, was 13·5\% in men, 13·6\% in women, and 60·6\% in FSWs (all values in FSWs standardised to age composition of women in the general population). The prevalence of C trachomatis infection was 4·2\% in men, 6·5\% in women, and 16·4\% in FSWs; of T vaginalis infection was 0·3\% in men, 4·9\% in women, and 7·9\% in FSWs; and of syphilis was 0·5\% in men, 0·4\% in women, and 0·8\% in FSWs. N gonorrhoeae infection had a prevalence of 0·1\% in men and women, and of 1·6\% in FSWs. Prevalence of HIV infection was 0·5\% in men and FSWs, and 0·1\% in women. Four (0·3\%) of 1535 specimens were positive for human T-lymphotropic virus 1. In men, 65·0\% of infections with HIV, 71·5\% of N gonorrhoeae, and 41·4\% of HSV2 and 60·9\% of cases of syphilis were in the 13·3\% who had sex with men or unprotected sex with FSWs in the past year. In women from the general population, 66·7\% of infections with HIV and 16·7\% of cases of syphilis were accounted for by the 4·4\% who had been paid for sex by any of their past three partners. INTERPRETATION: Defining of high-risk groups could guide targeting of interventions for communicable diseases-including STIs-in the general Peruvian population.

The rising migration flows towards Europe throughout the last few years are raising renewed concerns about management issues and the potential associated risk for the native population.
AIMS: To discuss the health implications and challenges related to the four phases of migration, from first arrival to stable resettlement.
SOURCES: Scientific literature and relevant statistical reports.
CONTENT: Although infectious diseases are not a health priority at first arrival, a syndromic screening to identify the most common communicable conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis above all) should be promptly conducted. Reception centres where asylum seekers are gathered after arrival may be crowded, so favouring epidemic outbreaks, sometimes caused by incomplete vaccine coverage for preventable diseases. After resettlement, the prevalence of some chronic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, viral hepatitis or tuberculosis largely reflects the epidemiological pattern in the country of origin, with poor living conditions being an additional driver. Once resettled, migrants usually travel back to their country of origin without seeking pre-travel advice, which results in a high incidence of malaria and other infections.
IMPLICATIONS: Although infectious diseases among migrants are known to have a negligible impact on European epidemiology, screening programmes need to be implemented and adapted to the different stages of the migratory process to better understand the trends and set priorities for action. Appropriate access to care regardless of the legal status is crucial to improve the health status and prevent the spread of contagious conditions.},

Only 15 (2.0\%) of the 750 individuals carried meningococci asymptomatically. Most of the strains were non-serogroupable and none were serogroup A. However, two individuals carried a serogroup W135 strain, sequence type (ST)-11, similar to the clone that was responsible for the epidemic in Burkina Faso in 2002.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Pertussis incidence markedly decreased due to universal vaccination, but outbreaks had been noted worldwide in recent decade. This study was conducted to know the epidemiology of pertussis and its impact on infants in Taiwan.
METHODS: Epidemiologic parameters for confirmed pertussis cases were collected from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The incidence of each age group over years was calculated using population data. We also did retrospective reviews of laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases in NTUH to analyze clinical characteristics and disease severity.
RESULTS: A total of 668 confirmed pertussis cases were obtained from the Taiwan CDC open database between 2003 and 2017. There was higher incidence during the period 2009-2015, with a mean incidence of 0.27 cases per 100,000 population, about 2-fold increase compared with mean incidence of 0.12 cases per 100,000 population during the period 2003-2008. Infants accounted for the highest proportion of all cases (49.8\%), with mean incidence of 16.1 cases per 100,000 people per year during 2009-2015, and a trend of increase was found from 2003 to 2015. In NTUH, a total of 17 laboratory-confirmed pertussis cases were diagnosed during 2012-2016, and 14 cases were young infants. Among them, 9 infants had been admitted to intensive care unit and 2 infant needed invasive ventilator support.
CONCLUSION: There was a resurgence of pertussis during 2009-2015 and it had significant impact on infants. Young infants with pertussis may be severe and need intensive care, so preventive strategy may be advocated for them.},

  abstract = {Gonorrhoea continues to be a public health problem in the UK, and is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) after chlamydia. In the UK, gonorrhoea is disproportionately concentrated in epidemiologically distinct subpopulations, with much higher incidence rates in young people, some ethnic minorities and inner city subpopulations. The original model of STI transmission proposed by Hethcote and Yorke explained some of these features through the concept of the 'core group'. Since then, several authors have modified the original model approach to include multiple sexual activity classes, but found this modelling approach to be inadequate when applied to low-prevalence settings such as the UK. We present a metapopulation framework for modelling gonorrhoea and other STIs. The model proposes that the epidemiology of gonorrhoea is largely driven by subpopulations with higher than average concentrations of individuals with high sexual risk activity. We show how this conceptualization of gonococcal epidemiology overcomes key limitations associated with some of the prior efforts to model gonorrhoea. We also use the model to explain several epidemiological features of gonorrhoea, such as its asymmetric distribution across subpopulations, and the contextual risk experienced by members of at-risk subpopulations. Finally, we extend the model to explain the distribution of other STIs, using chlamydia as an example of a more ubiquitous bacterial STI.},

  abstract = {Objectives
Evidence is limited on the relative contribution of different temperature exposures (i.e., heat, cold and significant temperature variability) to mortality. This study aims to examine mortality risk and associated mortality burden from heat, cold, and temperature variability in Australia.
Methods
We collected daily time-series data on all-cause deaths and weather variables for the five most populous Australian cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth), from 2000 to 2009. Temperature variability was calculated from the standard deviation of hourly temperatures between two adjacent days. Three-stage analysis was used. We firstly used quasi-Poisson regression models to model the associations of mortality with heat (mean temperature) during the warm season, with cold (mean temperature) during the cold season, and with temperature variability all year round, while controlling for long-term trend and seasonality, day of week, and population change over time. We then estimated the effects of different non-optimum temperatures using the simplified log-linear regression model. Finally, we computed and compared the fraction (\%) of deaths attributable to different non-optimum temperatures.
Results
The greatest percentage increase in mortality was for cold (2.0\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.4\%, 2.6\%), followed by heat (1.2\%, 95\% CI: 0.7\%, 1.7\%), and temperature variability (0.5\%, 95\% CI: 0.3\%, 0.7\%). There was no clear temporal pattern in mortality risk associated with any temperature exposure in Australia. Heat, cold and temperature variability together resulted in 42,414 deaths during the study period, accounting for about 6.0\% of all deaths. Most of attributable deaths were due to cold (61.4\%), and noticeably, contribution from temperature variability (28.0\%) was greater than that from heat (10.6\%).
Conclusions
Exposure to either cold or heat or a large variation in temperature was associated with increased mortality risk in Australia, but population adaptation appeared to have not occurred in most cities studied. Most of the temperature-induced deaths were attributable to cold, and contributions from temperature variability were greater than that from heat. Our findings highlight that, in addition to heat and cold, temperature variability needs to be considered in assessing and projecting the health impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2012 England and Wales experienced a resurgence of pertussis and an increase in infant deaths. This occurred 8~years after acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine replaced whole cell (wP) primary vaccine despite continued high coverage for the primary series and pre-school aP booster. We developed a mathematical model to describe pertussis transmission dynamics in England and Wales since the 1950s and used it to investigate the cause of the resurgence and the potential impact of additional vaccination strategies.
METHODS: An age-structured, compartmental, deterministic model of the pertussis transmission dynamics was fitted to 60 continuous years of age-stratified pertussis notification data in England and Wales. The model incorporated vaccine-induced and natural immunity and differentiated between vaccine-induced protection against clinical disease and infection.
RESULTS: The degree of protection of wP vaccine against infection was estimated to be higher than that of aP vaccine. Furthermore, the duration of protection for natural and wP-induced immunity was likely to be at least 15~years, but for aP vaccine it could be as low as 5~years. Model results indicated that the likely cause of the resurgence was the replacement of wP by less efficacious aP vaccine and that an elevated level of pertussis would continue. The collapse in wP vaccine coverage in the 1970s and resultant outbreaks in the late 1970s and early 1980s could not explain the resurgence. Addition of an adolescent or toddler booster was predicted to have little impact on the disease in infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the recent recommendation by the World Health Organisation that countries currently using wP vaccine for primary immunisation should not change to aP vaccine unless additional strategies to control infant disease such as maternal immunisation can be assured. Improved pertussis vaccines that provide better protection against infection are needed.},

Using epidemic modeling and data from two well-documented Ebola outbreaks (Congo 1995 and Uganda 2000), we estimate the number of secondary cases generated by an index case in the absence of control interventions R0. Our estimate of R0 is 1.83 (SD 0.06) for Congo (1995) and 1.34 (SD 0.03) for Uganda (2000). We model the course of the outbreaks via an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) epidemic model that includes a smooth transition in the transmission rate after control interventions are put in place. We perform an uncertainty analysis of the basic reproductive number R0 to quantify its sensitivity to other disease-related parameters. We also analyse the sensitivity of the final epidemic size to the time interventions begin and provide a distribution for the final epidemic size. The control measures implemented during these two outbreaks (including education and contact tracing followed by quarantine) reduce the final epidemic size by a factor of 2 relative the final size with a 2-week delay in their implementation.},

  abstract = {Predicting the impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases poses significant challenges. In this paper, we put forward a simple modelling framework to investigate the impact of heavy rainfall events (HREs) on mosquito-borne disease transmission in temperate areas of the world such as the southern coastal areas of the USA. In particular, we explore the impact of the timing of HREs relative to the transmission season via analyses that test the sensitivity of HRE-induced epidemics to variation in the effects of rainfall on the dynamics of mosquito breeding capacity, and the intensity and temporal profile of human population displacement patterns. The recent Hurricane Harvey in Texas motivates the simulations reported. Overall, we find that the impact of vector-borne disease transmission is likely to be greater the earlier the HREs occur in the transmission season. Simulations based on data for Hurricane Harvey suggest that the limited impact it had on vector-borne disease transmission was in part because of when it occurred (late August) relative to the local transmission season, and in part because of the mitigating effect of the displacement of people. We also highlight key data gaps related to models of vector-borne disease transmission in the context of natural disasters.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes’. This issue is linked with the subsequent theme issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control’.},

Pneumococcal vaccination is a key element to reduce the global burden of the disease in children and adult population. Our aim is to discuss current knowledge of the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal vaccines.
RECENT FINDINGS: After the introduction of conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13), rates of pneumococcal diseases because of vaccine serotypes have decreased considerably among children in the vaccine target and among nonvaccinated children and adults. Results of the Community-Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults demonstrated 45.6\% efficacy of PCV13 against the first episode of pneumonia, 45\% against first-episode nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and 75\% against the first episode of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults older than 65 years. Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination have changed recently in both the United States and Europe.
SUMMARY: The changing epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases should be closely investigated to assess the effectiveness and the usefulness of the current vaccination policies, and to identify future directions for preventing pneumococcal infections.},

DESIGN: A retrospective case note review of all 643 patients treated for NG at a GUM in north west England (January 2007-April 2009).
PARTICIPANTS: All 643 treated for NG (including CSP cases, since all cases were referred to GUM for treatment). Limited data were available for 13 CSP cases who failed to attend GUM.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Whether the case was detected in the community or GUM services. Predictors were demographics (age, gender, postcode for deprivation analysis), sexual history (eg, number of partners) and clinical factors (eg, culture positivity).
RESULTS: 131 cases were diagnosed by CSP (13 of whom did not attend GUM). A further four cases were contacts of these. The GUM caseload was thus inflated by 23\% (from 521 to 643). Community cases were overwhelmingly female (85\% vs 27\% in GUM, p{$<$}0.001) and younger (87\% females were {$<$}25 years vs 70\% GUM females, p=0.001). Logistic regression analysis restricted to the target age of the CSP ({$<$}25 years) revealed that CSP cases, compared with GUM cases, were more likely to reside in deprived areas (adjusted OR=5.6, 95\% CI 1.4 to 21.8 and 5.3, CI 1.7 to 16.6 for the most and second most deprived group respectively, compared with the averagely deprived group, p=0.037) and be asymptomatic (adjusted OR=1.9, CI 1.1 to 3.4, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Community screening for NG led to a 79\% increase in the number of infections detected in women aged {$<$}25 years. Screening is targeted at young people, and tends to disproportionately attract young women, a group under-represented at GUM. Screening also contributed further to case detection in deprived areas.},

Annual mortality from viral hepatitis is similar to that of other major infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Highly effective prevention measures and treatments have made the global elimination of viral hepatitis a realistic goal, endorsed by all WHO member states. Ambitious targets call for a global reduction in hepatitis-related mortality of 65\% and a 90\% reduction in new infections by 2030. This Commission draws together a wide range of expertise to appraise the current global situation and to identify priorities globally, regionally, and nationally needed to accelerate progress. We identify 20 heavily burdened countries that account for over 75\% of the global burden of viral hepatitis. Key recommendations include a greater focus on national progress towards elimination with support given, if necessary, through innovative financing measures to ensure elimination programmes are fully funded by 2020. In addition to further measures to improve access to vaccination and treatment, greater attention needs to be paid to access to affordable, high-quality diagnostics if testing is to reach the levels needed to achieve elimination goals. Simplified, decentralised models of care removing requirements for specialised prescribing will be required to reach those in need, together with sustained efforts to tackle stigma and discrimination. We identify key examples of the progress that has already been made in many countries throughout the world, demonstrating that sustained and coordinated efforts can be successful in achieving the WHO elimination goals.},

The new methods are described and the detection and quantification of outbreaks is presented for the period April 2006-March 2007. Sensitivity, specificity and timeliness are illustrated by means of a temporal comparison with known health events.
Relevant events are identified from important mortality risks: climate, air pollution and influenza. Baselines and thresholds for deaths by gender, age group, day and week are estimated by the method of Farrington et al. (J R Stat Soc Ser A, 159:547-563, 1996). By adding seasonal terms to the basic model, a complete 5-year reference period can be used, while a reduction of noise allows the application to daily counts.
Ignoring two false positives, all flags could be classified into five distinct outbreaks, coinciding with four heat periods and an influenza epidemic. Negative deviations from expected mortality in autumn and winter might reflect a displacement of mortality by the heat waves. Still, significant positive excess was found during five influenza weeks. Correcting for the delay in registration of deaths, outbreaks could be detected as soon as 1-2 weeks after the event.
The sensitivity of Be-MOMO to different health threats suggests its potential usefulness in early warning: mortality thresholds and baselines might serve as rapid tools for detecting and quantifying outbreaks, crucial for public health decision-making and evaluation of measures.},

The guidance emphasises that natural experiments can provide convincing evidence of impact even when effects are small or take time to appear. However, a good understanding is needed of the process determining exposure to the intervention, and careful choice and combination of methods, testing of assumptions and transparent reporting is vital. More could be learnt from natural experiments in future as experience of promising but lesser used methods accumulates.},

The package AF allows for confounder-adjusted estimation of the AF for the three major study designs: cross-sectional, (possibly matched) case-control and cohort. The article is divided into theoretical sections and applied sections. In the theoretical sections we describe how the confounder-adjusted AF is estimated for each specific study design. These sections serve as a brief but self-consistent tutorial in AF estimation. In the applied sections we use real data examples to illustrate how the AF package is used. All datasets in these examples are publicly available and included in the AF package, so readers can easily replicate all analyses.},

We also assessed tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine coverage among pregnant women from 2014, the year of the introduction of Tdap maternal immunization recommendation in Brazil, to 2016. Methods: Epidemiological data for incidence, prevalence, hospitalization, mortality, and maternal vaccination coverage were calculated based on the Brazilian public surveillance databases. Results: The epidemiological data analysis results showed that the pertussis average incidence rate (IR) was 2.19/100,000 inhabitants for all ages, with a peak in 2014 (4.03/100,000 inhabitants) and highest incidence in {$<$}1-year-old children (IR = 175.20/100,000). 97.6\% of pertussis deaths (405/415) were in {$<$}1-year-old children. Maternal immunization coverage was 9.2\% in 2014, 40.4\% in 2015, and 33.8\% in 2016. Conclusions: Pertussis incidence and pertussis-related deaths increased in Brazil from 2010 to 2014 and decreased in 2015. In the two years, 2015 and 2016 that followed the NIP recommendation, Tdap vaccination coverage of pregnant women was low and varying from region to region. More efforts and national plans would help increase awareness and maternal immunization coverage.},

Using available Dutch data, a dynamic transmission model for the spread of pneumococci and potential subsequent invasive pneumococcal disease has been adapted to the Dutch setting. Overall, invasive pneumococcal disease cases in the Netherlands are predicted to decrease from a pre-vaccination level of 2623 cases annually to 2475, 2289, 2185, 2179, and 2178 cases annually 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-years, respectively, post-vaccination. Therefore, vaccination with PCV13 in the Netherlands is predicted to lower invasive pneumococcal disease cases per year by up to 445 cases in the medium- to long-term. The results are quite robust for the sensitivity analyses performed on the parameters that regulate herd immunity and competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Quebec, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program was implemented in December 2004. The recommended schedule is 2+1 doses for low-risk infants. PCV-7 was first used (including catch-up for children {$<$}5 years of age), replaced by PCV10 in June 2009, and by PCV13 in January 2011 (no catch-up in both instances). From the beginning, {$>$}90\% of children received the recommended number of doses.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the three PCVs sequentially used to prevent invasive infectious disease (IPD).
METHODS: IPD cases in children 2-59 months during the years 2005-2013 were eligible. Controls were randomly identified in the provincial health insurance registry. Parents were interviewed and immunization records reviewed. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was computed using multivariate logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Out of 889 IPD cases reported, full participation was obtained for 516 cases (58\%) and for 1767 controls. Against vaccine-type IPD, VE (≥1 dose) was 90\% (82-95\%) for PCV7, 97\% (84-99\%) for PCV10 and 86\% (62-95\%) for PCV13. Against 19A IPD, VE was, respectively, 42\% (-9\% to 69\%), 71\% (24-89\%), and 74\% (11-92\%). VE (≥2 doses) against PCV13-type IPD was 85\% for PCV10 (66-94\%), 85\% for PCV13 (55-94\%), and 89\% (58-97\%) for a mixed PCV10+PCV13 schedule.
CONCLUSIONS: All three PCV vaccines showed high level of protection against IPD caused by serotypes included in their formulation and there was a high level of cross-protection against 19A for PCV10. No substantial difference was seen between PCV10, PCV13, or a mixed PCV10+PCV13 schedule.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 10-valent protein D pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was licensed on the basis of immunogenicity studies and there are no published data on its effectiveness to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). In the province of Quebec, Canada, PHiD-CV was introduced in the summer of 2009, replacing the 7-valent CRM197 vaccine (PCV-7). Transition to the new vaccine was recommended regardless of the number of PCV7 doses already administered.
METHODS: IPD rates in children born in 2007-2010 and observed up to the end of 2010 were computed from laboratory surveillance data. The main vaccine used for the infant primary immunization series (mainly 2 doses at 2-4 months) and the toddler (12 months) booster dose was inferred from the Quebec City Immunization Registry data.
RESULTS: IPD rates were significantly lower in the cohorts exposed to PHiD-CV (35/100,000 person-years) as compared with those exposed to PCV-7 (64/100,000 person-years; p=0.03). There was no breakthrough vaccine-type IPD case among children who had received ≥2 PHiD-CV doses for the primary series or a single PHiD-CV dose as a booster. There was also a statistically non-significant lower frequency of 19A and other non-vaccine types IPD cases in children exposed to 2+1 PHiD-CV doses as compared with those exposed to PCV-7.
INTERPRETATION: Results are compatible with a high level of protection induced by PHiD-CV against IPD caused by homologous serotypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The present study aimed at developing a standardized heat wave definition to estimate and compare the impact on mortality by gender, age and death causes in Europe during summers 1990-2004 and 2003, separately, accounting for heat wave duration and intensity.
METHODS: Heat waves were defined considering both maximum apparent temperature and minimum temperature and classified by intensity, duration and timing during summer. The effect was estimated as percent increase in daily mortality during heat wave days compared to non heat wave days in people over 65 years. City specific and pooled estimates by gender, age and cause of death were calculated.
RESULTS: The effect of heat waves showed great geographical heterogeneity among cities. Considering all years, except 2003, the increase in mortality during heat wave days ranged from + 7.6\% in Munich to + 33.6\% in Milan. The increase was up to 3-times greater during episodes of long duration and high intensity. Pooled results showed a greater impact in Mediterranean (+ 21.8\% for total mortality) than in North Continental (+ 12.4\%) cities. The highest effect was observed for respiratory diseases and among women aged 75-84 years. In 2003 the highest impact was observed in cities where heat wave episode was characterized by unusual meteorological conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Climate change scenarios indicate that extreme events are expected to increase in the future even in regions where heat waves are not frequent. Considering our results prevention programs should specifically target the elderly, women and those suffering from chronic respiratory disorders, thus reducing the impact on mortality.},

  abstract = {Pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory infection, remains a public health priority despite the availability of vaccines for 70 years. Still a leading cause of mortality in developing countries, pertussis has re-emerged in several developed countries with high vaccination coverage. Resurgence of pertussis in these countries has routinely been attributed to increased awareness of the disease, imperfect vaccinal protection or high infection rates in adults. In this review, we first present 1980-2012 incidence data from 63 countries and show that pertussis resurgence is not universal. We further argue that the large geographical variation in trends probably precludes a simple explanation, such as the transition from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines. Reviewing available evidence, we then propose that prevailing views on pertussis epidemiology are inconsistent with both historical and contemporary data. Indeed, we summarize epidemiological evidence showing that natural infection and vaccination both appear to provide long-term protection against transmission and disease, so that previously infected or vaccinated adults contribute little to overall transmission at a population level. Finally, we identify several promising avenues that may lead to a consistent explanation of global pertussis epidemiology and to more effective control strategies.},

  abstract = {The resurgence of pertussis over the past decades has resulted in incidence levels not witnessed in the United States since the 1950s. The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In March 2010, Brazil introduced the ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10), which was licensed based on non-inferiority of immunological correlates of protection compared with the seven-valent vaccine. The schedule comprised three primary doses at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months, and a booster dose at age 12 months. A single catch-up dose was offered for children aged 12-23 months at the time of introduction. We assessed PCV10 effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease in Brazilian children.
METHODS: Invasive pneumococcal disease, defined as isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or another normally sterile site, was identified in children age-eligible for at least one PCV10 dose through laboratory-based and hospital-based surveillance in ten states in Brazil from March 1, 2010, until Dec 31, 2012. We aimed to identify four age-matched and neighbourhood-matched controls for each case. We used conditional logistic regression and calculated PCV10 effectiveness as (1-adjusted matched odds ratio) × 100\% for vaccine-type and vaccine-related serotypes (ie, in the same serogroup as a vaccine serotype).
FINDINGS: In 316 cases (median age 13·2 months, range 2·6-53·1) and 1219 controls (13·3 months, 2·6-53·1), the adjusted effectiveness of an age-appropriate PCV10 schedule was 83·8\% (95\% CI 65·9-92·3) against vaccine serotypes, and 77·9\% (41·0-91·7) against vaccine-related serotypes. Serotype-specific effectiveness was shown for the two most common vaccine serotypes-14 (87·7\%, 60·8-96·1) and 6B (82·8\%, 23·8-96·1)-and serotype 19A (82·2\%, 10·7-96·4), a serotype related to vaccine serotype 19F. A single catch-up dose in children aged 12-23 months was effective against vaccine-type disease (68·0\%, 17·6-87·6). No significant effectiveness was shown against non-vaccine serotypes for age-appropriate or catch-up schedules.
INTERPRETATION: In the routine immunisation programme in Brazil, PCV10 prevents invasive disease caused by vaccine serotypes. PCV10 might provide cross-protection against some vaccine-related serotypes.

  abstract = {Background
The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed based on the results of immunogenicity studies and correlates of protection derived from randomized clinical trials of the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. We assessed the vaccination effectiveness (VE) of the PCV13 in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children aged 7–59 months in a population with suboptimal vaccination coverage of 55\%.

Methods
The study was carried out in children with IPD admitted to three hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) and controls matched by hospital, age, sex, date of hospitalization and underlying disease. Information on the vaccination status was obtained from written medical records. Conditional logistic regression was made to estimate the adjusted VE and 95\% confidence intervals (CI).

Results
169 cases and 645 controls were included. The overall VE of ≥1 doses of PCV13 in preventing IPD due to vaccine serotypes was 75.8\% (95\% CI, 54.1–87.2) and 90\% (95\% CI, 63.9–97.2) when ≥2 doses before 12 months, two doses on or after 12 months or one dose on or after 24 months, were administered. The VE of ≥1 doses was 89\% (95\% CI, 42.7–97.9) against serotype 1 and 86.0\% (95\% CI, 51.2–99.7) against serotype 19A. Serotype 3 showed a non-statistically significant effectiveness (25.9\%; 95\% CI, -65.3 to 66.8).

Conclusions
The effectiveness of ≥1 doses of PCV13 in preventing IPD caused by all PCV13 serotypes in children aged 7–59 months was good and, except for serotype 3, the effectiveness of ≥1 doses against the most frequent PCV13 serotypes causing IPD was high when considered individually.},

  abstract = {Summer warming trends in Western Europe are increasing the incidence, intensity and duration of heat waves. They are especially deadly in large cities owing to population density, physical surface properties, anthropogenic heat and pollutants. In August 2003, for 9 consecutive days, the Paris metropolitan area experienced an extreme heat wave that caused 4867 estimated heat-related deaths. A set of 61 NOAA-AVHRR (advanced very high-resolution radiometer) images and one SPOT-high resolution visible (HRV) image were used to analyse the spatial variations of land surface temperature (LST) over the diurnal cycle during the heat wave. The LST patterns were markedly different between daytime and night-time. A heat island was centred downtown at night, whereas multiple temperature anomalies were scattered in the industrial suburbs during the day. The heat wave corresponded to elevated nocturnal LST compared to normal summers. The highest mortality ratios matched the spatial distribution of the highest night-time LSTs, but were not related to the highest daytime LSTs. LSTs were sampled from images at the addresses of 482 elderly people (half were deceased persons and half were control ones) to produce daily and cumulative minimal, maximal and mean thermal indicators, over various periods of time. These indicators were integrated into a conditional logistic regression model to test their use as heat exposure indicators, based on risk factors. Over the period 1–13 August, thermal indicators taking into account minimum nocturnal temperatures averaged over 7 days or over the whole period were significantly linked to mortality. These results show the extent of the spatial variability in urban climate variables and the impact of night-time temperatures on excess mortality. These results should be used to inform policy and contingency planning in relation to heat waves, and highlight the role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting and preventing heat-related mortality.

Pneumococcal disease is roughly divided into non-invasive and invasive disease. The burden of non-invasive pneumococcal disease in adults is mainly determined by community-acquired pneumonia. Pneumococcal pneumonia has high incidence rates and carries a high mortality risk, especially in the elderly. Within the cluster of invasive pneumococcal diseases, pneumonia also represents the most common infectious source. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcal disease. The current review summarizes the current knowledge on the epidemiology including outcome of the main clinical forms of pneumococcal disease, with a special focus on elderly patients. Furthermore, the economic burden and future vaccine strategies are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Austria has been among the main European countries hosting incoming asylum seekers since 2015. Consequently, there was an urgent need to predict any public health threats associated with the arriving asylum seekers. The Department of Surveillance and Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) was mandated to implement a national syndrome-based surveillance system in the 7 reception centers by the Austrian Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Health. Objective: We aimed to analyze the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases among asylum seekers using data reported by reception centers through the syndrome-based surveillance system from September 2015 through February 2018. Methods: We deployed a daily data collection system for 13 syndromes: rash with fever; rash without fever; acute upper respiratory tract infection; acute lower respiratory tract infection; meningitis or encephalitis; fever and bleeding; nonbloody gastroenteritis or watery diarrhea; bloody diarrhea; acute jaundice; skin, soft tissue, or bone abnormalities; acute flaccid paralysis; high fever with no other signs; and unexplained death. General practitioners, the first professionals to consult for health problems at reception centers in Austria, sent the tally sheets on identified syndromes daily to the AGES. Results: We identified a total of 2914 cases, presenting 8 of the 13 syndromes. A total of 405 signals were triggered, and 6.4\% (26/405) of them generated alerts. Suspected acute upper respiratory tract infection (1470/2914, 50.45\% of cases), rash without fever (1174/2914, 40.29\% of cases), suspected acute lower respiratory tract infection (159/2914, 5.46\% of cases), watery diarrhea (73/2914, 2.51\% of cases), and skin, soft tissue, or bone abnormalities (32/2914, 1.10\% of cases) were the top 5 syndromes. Conclusions: The cooperation of the AGES with reception center health care staff, supported by the 2 involved ministries, was shown to be useful for syndromic surveillance of infectious diseases among asylum seekers. None of the identified alerts escalated to an outbreak.  [JMIR Public Health Surveill 2019;5(1):e11465]},

  abstract = {Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has now spread to a number of countries worldwide. While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number
R
0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others., 
Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the~World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution., 
Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of
R
0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter
k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95\% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80\% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (\textasciitilde{}10\%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for
R
0 and
k (95\% CrIs:
R
0 1.4-12;
k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of
R
0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution., 
Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the European Union (EU), treatment and cure of HCV with direct-acting antiviral therapies began in 2014. WHO targets are to achieve a 65\% reduction in liver-related deaths, a 90\% reduction of new viral hepatitis infections, and 90\% of patients with viral hepatitis infections being diagnosed by 2030. This study assessed the prevalence of HCV in the EU and the level of intervention required to achieve WHO targets for HCV elimination.
METHODS: We populated country Markov models for the 28 EU countries through a literature search of PubMed and Embase between Jan 1, 2000, and March 31, 2016, and a Delphi process to gain expert consensus and validate inputs. We aggregated country models to create a regional EU model. We used the EU model to forecast HCV disease progression (considering the effect of immigration) and developed a strategy to acehive WHO targets. We used weighted average sustained viral response rates and fibrosis restrictions to model the effect of current therapeutic guidelines. We used the EU model to forecast HCV disease progression (considering the effect of immigration) under current screening and therapeutic guidelines. Additionally, we back-calculated the total number of patients needing to be screened and treated to achieve WHO targets.
FINDINGS: We estimated the number of viraemic HCV infections in 2015 to be 3\hphantom{,}238\hphantom{,}000 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 2\hphantom{,}106\hphantom{,}000-3\hphantom{,}795\hphantom{,}000) of a total population of 509\hphantom{,}868\hphantom{,}000 in the EU, equating to a prevalence of viraemic HCV of 0·64\% (95\% UI 0·41-0·74). We estimated that 1\hphantom{,}180\hphantom{,}000 (95\% UI 1\hphantom{,}003\hphantom{,}000-1\hphantom{,}357\hphantom{,}000) people were diagnosed with viraemia (36·4\%), 150\hphantom{,}000 (12\hphantom{,}000-180\hphantom{,}000) were treated (4·6\% of the total infected population or 12·7\% of the diagnosed population), 133\hphantom{,}000 (106\hphantom{,}000-160\hphantom{,}000) were cured (4·1\%), and 57\hphantom{,}900 (43\hphantom{,}900-67\hphantom{,}300) were newly infected (1·8\%) in 2015. Additionally, 30\hphantom{,}400 (26\hphantom{,}600-42\hphantom{,}500) HCV-positive immigrants entered the EU. To achieve WHO targets, unrestricted treatment needs to increase from 150\hphantom{,}000 patients in 2015 to 187\hphantom{,}000 patients in 2025 and diagnosis needs to increase from 88\hphantom{,}800 new cases annually in 2015 to 180\hphantom{,}000 in 2025.
INTERPRETATION: Given its advanced health-care infrastructure, the EU is uniquely poised to eliminate HCV; however, expansion of screening programmes is essential to increase treatment to achieve the WHO targets. A united effort, grounded in sound epidemiological evidence, will also be necessary.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million yearly deaths worldwide. An up-to-date evidence base on the effects of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) on infectious diseases and mortality in any population or setting regardless of age or health status is currently lacking.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently screened 9498 titles/abstracts and 430 full-text papers for eligible trials. The outcomes of our meta-analysis were pooled using relative risks (RRs) with a random effects model or Peto's odds ratios (ORs) if event rates were :lt;1\%.
RESULTS: 21 RCTs comprising 361 612 individuals were included. PCVs reduced the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: [0.36; 0.51]), all-cause acute otitis media (AOM) (RR: 0.93, 95\% CI: [0.86; 1.00]), pneumococcal AOM (RR: 0.57, 95\% CI: [0.39; 0.83]), allcause pneumonia (RR: 0.93, 95\% CI: [0.89; 0.97]), and pneumococcal pneumonia (RR: 0.78, 95\% CI: [0.62; 0.97]). We found no significant effect of PCVs on all-cause mortality (RR: 0.95, 95\% CI: [0.88; 1.03]) or recurrent AOM (RR: 0.87, 95\% CI: [0.72; 1.05]).
CONCLUSION: PCVs are associated with large risk reductions for pneumococcal infectious diseases, smaller risk reductions for infectious diseases from any cause, and no significant effect on all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Advances in computers and biotechnology have had a profound impact on biomedical research, and as a result complex data sets can now be generated to address extremely complex biological questions. Correspondingly, advances in the statistical methods necessary to analyze such data are following closely behind the advances in data generation methods. The statistical methods required by bioinformatics present many new and difficult problems for the research community. This book provides an introduction to some of these new methods. The main biological topics treated include sequence analysis, BLAST, microarray analysis, gene finding, and the analysis of evolutionary processes. The main statistical techniques covered include hypothesis testing and estimation, Poisson processes, Markov models and Hidden Markov models, and multiple testing methods. The second edition features new chapters on microarray analysis and on statistical inference, including a discussion of ANOVA, and discussions of the statistical theory of motifs and methods based on the hypergeometric distribution. Much material has been clarified and reorganized. The book is written so as to appeal to biologists and computer scientists who wish to know more about the statistical methods of the field, as well as to trained statisticians who wish to become involved with bioinformatics. The earlier chapters introduce the concepts of probability and statistics at an elementary level, but with an emphasis on material relevant to later chapters and often not covered in standard introductory texts. Later chapters should be immediately accessible to the trained statistician. Sufficient mathematical background consists of introductory courses in calculus and linear algebra. The basic biological concepts that are used are explained, or can be understood from the context, and standard mathematical concepts are summarized in an Appendix. Problems are provided at the end of each chapter allowing the reader to develop aspects of the theory outlined in the main text. Warren J. Ewens holds the Christopher H. Brown Distinguished Professorship at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of two books, Population Genetics and Mathematical Population Genetics. He is a senior editor of Annals of Human Genetics and has served on the editorial boards of Theoretical Population Biology, GENETICS, Proceedings of the Royal Society B and SIAM Journal in Mathematical Biology. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and the Australian Academy of Science. Gregory R.

He obtained his Ph.D. in number theory from the University of Maryland in 1995 and his Masters in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1999. Comments on the first edition: "This book would be an ideal text for a postgraduate course…[and] is equally well suited to individual study…. I would recommend the book highly." (Biometrics) "Ewens and Grant have given us a very welcome introduction to what is behind those pretty [graphical user] interfaces." (Naturwissenschaften) "The authors do an excellent job of presenting the essence of the material without getting bogged down in mathematical details." (Journal American Statistical Association) "The authors have restructured classical material to a great extent and the new organization of the different topics is one of the outstanding services of the book."

Several different confidence intervals are available, but they can produce markedly different results. Some of the traditional approaches, such as the Wald interval for the difference between proportions and the Katz log interval for the ratio of proportions, do not perform well unless the sample size is large. Better intervals are available. This article describes and compares approximate and exact confidence intervals that are - with one exception - easy to calculate or available in common software packages.

Neither vaccine obtained regulatory approval based on efficacy trials, but instead were approved based on a surrogate end point: immunogenicity data measuring effective antibody levels. Therefore, direct measures of efficacy were unavailable at the time economic analyses were conducted. The authors systematically reviewed cost–effectiveness studies of ten-valent PCV and 13-valent PCV from the literature to analyze the methodologies and compare the assumptions made about vaccine effectiveness. The following three inputs were found the most variant across analyses: efficacy against acute otitis media; inclusion of indirect effects; and cross protection.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine-serotype (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) rates declined substantially following introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into national immunization programs. Increases in non-vaccine-serotype (NVT) IPD rates occurred in some sites, presumably representing serotype replacement. We used a standardized approach to describe serotype-specific IPD changes among multiple sites after PCV7 introduction.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Of 32 IPD surveillance datasets received, we identified 21 eligible databases with rate data ≥ 2 years before and ≥ 1 year after PCV7 introduction. Expected annual rates of IPD absent PCV7 introduction were estimated by extrapolation using either Poisson regression modeling of pre-PCV7 rates or averaging pre-PCV7 rates. To estimate whether changes in rates had occurred following PCV7 introduction, we calculated site specific rate ratios by dividing observed by expected IPD rates for each post-PCV7 year. We calculated summary rate ratios (RRs) using random effects meta-analysis. For children {$<$}5 years old, overall IPD decreased by year 1 post-PCV7 (RR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.46-0.65) and remained relatively stable through year 7 (RR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.35-0.68). Point estimates for VT IPD decreased annually through year 7 (RR 0.03, 95\% CI 0.01-0.10), while NVT IPD increased (year 7 RR 2.81, 95\% CI 2.12-3.71). Among adults, decreases in overall IPD also occurred but were smaller and more variable by site than among children. At year 7 after introduction, significant reductions were observed (18-49 year-olds [RR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.29-0.91], 50-64 year-olds [RR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.77-0.93], and ≥ 65 year-olds [RR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.58-0.95]).
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent and significant decreases in both overall and VT IPD in children occurred quickly and were sustained for 7 years after PCV7 introduction, supporting use of PCVs. Increases in NVT IPD occurred in most sites, with variable magnitude. These findings may not represent the experience in low-income countries or the effects after introduction of higher valency PCVs. High-quality, population-based surveillance of serotype-specific IPD rates is needed to monitor vaccine impact as more countries, including low-income countries, introduce PCVs and as higher valency PCVs are used.

  abstract = {Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) and conjugate vaccines (PCVs), of which PPV23 and PCV13 are the current front runners, have had a significant, beneficial impact on public health. With regard to PPV23, there has been some debate, however, about its protective efficacy against all-cause pneumonia, as opposed to invasive pneumococcal disease, in high-risk cases. PCVs, on the other hand, have been included in many national immunisation programmes for prevention of severe pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, as well as for adults in various high-risk categories. Although innovative and effective, the protective efficacy of PCVs, the composition of which is based on the geographic prevalence and virulence of pneumococcal serotypes, is limited due to colonisation of the nasopharynx with non-vaccine serotypes. This phenomenon of serotype replacement has provided the impetus for development of new generation recombinant protein and whole cell pneumococcal vaccines with the potential to provide serotype-independent protection. In addition to an overview of the successes and limitations of PPVs and PCVs, this review is focused on emerging and pipeline protein-based and whole cell vaccines, preceded by a consideration of conserved pneumococcal virulence factors which are potential vaccine candidates.},

This microorganism remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia and is associated with a considerable burden of disease and health-care costs in both developed and developing countries. Emerging antibiotic resistance has been a concern because of its potential negative impact on the outcome of patients who receive standard antibiotic therapy. However, there have been substantial changes in the epidemiology of this pathogen in recent years, not least of which has been due to the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children, with subsequent herd protection in unvaccinated adults and children. Furthermore, much recent research has led to a better understanding of the virulence factors of this pathogen and their role in the pathogenesis of severe pneumococcal disease, including the cardiac complications, as well as the potential role of adjunctive therapy in the management of severely ill cases.

  abstract = {This book is to be recommended as a standard shelf reference . . .  and as a ‘must’ to be read by all who wish to better  use and understand data involving dichotomous or dichotomizable  measurements.  —American Journal of Psychiatry   In the two decades since the second edition of Statistical  Methods for Rates and Proportions was published, evolving  technologies and new methodologies have significantly changed the  way today’s statistics are viewed and handled. The explosive  development of personal computing and statistical software has  facilitated the sophisticated analysis of data, putting  capabilities that were once the domain of specialists into the  hands of every researcher.  The Third Edition of this important text addresses these  changes and brings the literature up to date. While the previous  edition focused on the use of desktop and handheld calculators, the  new edition takes full advantage of modern computing power without  losing the elegant simplicity that made the text so popular with  students and practitioners alike. In authoritative yet clear  terminology, the authors have brought the science of data analysis  up to date without compromising its accessibility.  Features of the Third Edition include:    New material on sample size calculations and issues in clinical  trials, and entirely new chapters on single-sample data, logistic  regression, Poisson regression, regression models for matched  samples, the analysis of correlated binary data, and methods for  analyzing fourfold tables with missing data  The addition of many new problems, both numerical and  theoretical  Answer sections for numerical problems and hints for tackling  the theoretical ones  A frequentist approach enhanced by the inclusion of empirical  Bayesian methodology where appropriate    Combining the latest research with the original studies that  established the previous editions as leaders in the field,  Statistical Methods for Rates and Proportions, Third Edition  will continue to be an invaluable resource for students,  statisticians, biostatisticians, and epidemiologists.},

Clinical information was collected for children and adults with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).The IPD incidence decreased post-PCV7, but not post-PCV13, in vaccinated children. Beneficial herd effects were seen in older children and adults, but not in the elderly. The herd protection was more pronounced post-PCV7 than post-PCV13. PCV7 serotypes decreased. IPD caused by PCV13 serotypes 3 and 19A increased post-PCV7. Post-PCV13, serotypes 6A and 19A, but not serotype 3, decreased. The serotype distribution changed in carriage and IPD to nonvaccine types, also in nonvaccinated populations. Expansion of non-PCV13 serotypes was largest following PCV13 introduction. Serotype diversity increased and nonvaccine clones emerged, such as CC433 (serotype 22F) in IPD and CC62 (serotype 11A) in carriage. In young children, meningitis, septicaemia and severe rhinosinusitis, but not bacteraemic pneumonia, decreased.Pneumococcal vaccination leads to expansion of new or minor serotypes/clones, also in nonvaccinated populations.},

  abstract = {Over the past ten years the incidence of pertussis in the United States (U.S.) has risen steadily, with 2012 seeing the highest case number since 1955. There has also been a shift over the same time period in the age group reporting the largest number of cases (aside from infants), from adolescents to 7-11 year olds. We use epidemiological modelling and a large case incidence dataset to explain the upsurge. We investigate several hypotheses for the upsurge in pertussis cases by fitting a suite of dynamic epidemiological models to incidence data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) between 1990-2009, as well as incidence data from a variety of sources from 1950-1989. We find that: the best-fitting model is one in which vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine is lower than that of the whole-cell (wP) vaccine, (efficacy of the first three doses 80\% [95\% CI: 78\%, 82\%] versus 90\% [95\% CI: 87\%, 94\%]), increasing the rate at which disease is reported to NNDSS is not sufficient to explain the upsurge and 3) 2010-2012 disease incidence is predicted well. In this study, we use all available U.S. surveillance data to: 1) fit a set of mathematical models and determine which best explains these data and 2) determine the epidemiological and vaccine-related parameter values of this model. We find evidence of a difference in efficacy and duration of protection between the two vaccine types, wP and aP (aP efficacy and duration lower than wP). Future refinement of the model presented here will allow for an exploration of alternative vaccination strategies such as different age-spacings, further booster doses, and cocooning.},

It is widely believed that the core group is important in the persistence of infection and that it provides a sensible target for control interventions. GOAL OF THIS STUDY AND STUDY DESIGN: Simple mathematical models are used to assess the significance of sexual mixing between core and noncore groups. Published data from contact tracing studies, which base the definition of the core group on gonorrhea incidence by area of residence, are used to derive estimates of the degree of mixing within and between groups.
RESULTS: Analyses reveal patterns of high mixing within core groups in the urban study sites, which suggests that within-group transmission ensures the persistence of gonococcal infection in the community as a whole.
CONCLUSIONS: An extension of the analysis of contact tracing data to facilitate the development of mathematical models of STD transmission is detailed.},

  abstract = {A survey of the sexual behaviour of gonorrhoea patients in Newark was undertaken to evaluate parameters within a model of gonorrhoea transmission. Modelling work aimed to explain observed epidemiological patterns and to explore the potential impact of interventions. Reported behaviours, along with values derived from the literature, were used within a standard deterministic model of gonorrhoea transmission, where the population was stratified according to sex and rates of sex-partner change. The behaviours reported, particularly among women, are insufficient by themselves to explain the continued existence of gonorrhoea within the population. The majority of symptomatic patients seek treatment within a few days, and report that they do not have unprotected sex while symptomatic. The proportion of patients with low numbers of sex partners suggests that sexual mixing between people categorized according to sexual behaviour is near random. To explain the persistence of gonorrhoea, there must be some patients who, when infected, do not seek care in public clinics. In addition, gonorrhoea incidence in the model is sensitive to change, such that very small reductions in risk behaviour could lead to its elimination. This does not accord with the observed failure of many interventions to eliminate infection, suggesting that the modelled infection is too sensitive to change. The model, which has been influential in gonorrhoea epidemiology, is not consistent with the observed epidemiology of gonorrhoea in populations. Alternative models need to explore the observed stability of gonorrhoea before robust modelling conclusions can be drawn on how best to control infection. However, the current results do highlight the potential importance of asymptomatic infections and infections in those who are diseased and do not attend public health services. Screening and contact-tracing to identify asymptomatic infections in both men and women will be more effective in reaching those who maintain the infection within the community rather than simply treating symptomatic cases.},

We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature–mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We analysed 74 225 200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71\% (95\% empirical CI 7·43–7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37\% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00\% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80–90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7·29\%, 7·02–7·49) than by heat (0·42\%, 0·39–0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86\% (0·84–0·87) of total mortality.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold.

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important human pathogen. Its virulence is largely due to its polysaccharide capsule, which shields it from the host immune system, and because of this, the capsule has been extensively studied. Studies of the capsule led to the identification of DNA as the genetic material, identification of many different capsular serotypes, and identification of the serotype-specific nature of protection by adaptive immunity. Recent studies have led to the determination of capsular polysaccharide structures for many serotypes using advanced analytical technologies, complete elucidation of genetic basis for the capsular types, and the development of highly effective pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Conjugate vaccine use has altered the serotype distribution by either serotype replacement or switching, and this has increased the need to serotype pneumococci. Due to great advances in molecular technologies and our understanding of the pneumococcal genome, molecular approaches have become powerful tools to predict pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, more-precise and -efficient serotyping methods that directly detect polysaccharide structures are emerging. These improvements in our capabilities will greatly enhance future investigations of pneumococcal epidemiology and diseases and the biology of colonization and innate immunity to pneumococcal capsules.},

Yet, VE does not reflect a vaccine’s public health impact because it does not account for relative disease incidence. An additional measure that more directly establishes a vaccine’s public health value is the vaccine preventable disease incidence (VPDI), which is the incidence of disease preventable by vaccine in a given context. We describe how VE and VPDI can vary, sometimes in inverse directions, across disease outcomes and vaccinated populations. We provide examples of how VPDI can be used to reveal the relative public health impact of vaccines in developing countries, which can be masked by focus on VE alone. We recommend that VPDI be incorporated along with VE into the analytic plans of vaccine trials, as well as decisions by funders, ministries of health, and regulatory authorities.},

The perinatal program region is contrasted with a control region to provide a basis for interpretation of differences noted. Relevant segmented regression models provided good fits to the data and highlighted mortality trends over the last 30 years. Considerable racial differences in these trends were identified, particularly for postneonatal mortality. Segmented regression is considered relevant for the analysis of interrupted time series designs in other applications when errors can be taken to be independent.

  abstract = {The ubiquity of oscillations in epidemics presents a long standing challenge for the formulation of epidemic models. Whether they are external and seasonally driven, or arise from the intrinsic dynamics is an open problem. It is known that fixed time delays destabilize the steady state solution of the standard SIRS model, giving rise to stable oscillations for certain parameters values. In this contribution, starting from the classical SIRS model, we make a general treatment of the recovery and loss of immunity terms. We present oscillation diagrams (amplitude and period) in terms of the parameters of the model, showing how oscillations can be destabilized by the shape of the distributions of the two characteristic (infectious and immune) times. The formulation is made in terms of delay equations which are both numerically integrated and linearized. Results from simulations are included showing where they support the linear analysis and explaining why not where they do not. Considerations and comparison with real diseases are presented along.},

One important element of this plan has been the development of a timely mortality surveillance system. This article reports the findings and timeliness of a daily mortality model used to 'nowcast' excess mortality (utilising incomplete surveillance data to estimate the number of deaths in near-real time) during a heatwave alert issued by the Met Office for regions in South and East England on 24 June 2011.
METHODS: Daily death registrations were corrected for reporting delays with historical data supplied by the General Registry Office. These corrected counts were compared with expected counts from an age-specific linear regression model to ascertain if any excess had occurred during the heatwave.
RESULTS: Excess mortality of 367 deaths was detected across England and Wales in ≥85-year-olds on 26 and 27 June 2011, coinciding with the period of elevated temperature. This excess was localised to the east of England and London. It was detected 3 days after the heatwave.
CONCLUSION: A daily mortality model was sensitive and timely enough to rapidly detect a small excess, both, at national and regional levels. This tool will be useful when future events of public health significance occur.},

  abstract = {QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: During June to August 2003, high temperatures were reported across Europe including Switzerland. In many European countries, particularly in France the heat wave was associated with an increase in mortality. This is the first analysis investigating whether the high temperatures during summer 2003 in Switzerland had a measurable impact on mortality.
METHODS: Daily data on all-cause mortality for the period January 1990 to December 2003, and meteorological data from 20 different stations for the same period were analysed. Excess mortality for different age groups, gender and geographic regions was calculated. Daily mortality and temperature in 2003 was correlated with lags of temperature up to 7 days.
RESULTS: An estimated 7\% increase in all cause mortality occurred during June to August 2003. Excess mortality was limited to the region north of the Alps, to inhabitants of cities and suburban areas and was more pronounced among the elderly and the inhabitants of Basel, Geneva and Lausanne. North of the Alps, deviations in daily mortality were significantly correlated with deviations in maximum daily temperatures and night temperatures. The combination of day temperature above 35 degrees C and night temperatures above 20 degrees C predominantly occurred in Basel and Geneva and might in part explain the regional differences in excess mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: As the number of elderly people in Switzerland continues to rise and the occurrence of heat waves is predicted to increase as a consequence of global warming, preventive programmes targeting susceptible populations during heat waves are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have examined the effects of temperature on mortality in a single city, country, or region. However, less evidence is available on the variation in the associations between temperature and mortality in multiple countries, analyzed simultaneously.
METHODS: We obtained daily data on temperature and mortality in 306 communities from 12 countries/regions (Australia, Brazil, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada). Two-stage analyses were used to assess the nonlinear and delayed relation between temperature and mortality. In the first stage, a Poisson regression allowing overdispersion with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to estimate the community-specific temperature-mortality relation. In the second stage, a multivariate meta-analysis was used to pool the nonlinear and delayed effects of ambient temperature at the national level, in each country.
RESULTS: The temperatures associated with the lowest mortality were around the 75th percentile of temperature in all the countries/regions, ranging from 66th (Taiwan) to 80th (UK) percentiles. The estimated effects of cold and hot temperatures on mortality varied by community and country. Meta-analysis results show that both cold and hot temperatures increased the risk of mortality in all the countries/regions. Cold effects were delayed and lasted for many days, whereas heat effects appeared quickly and did not last long.
CONCLUSIONS: People have some ability to adapt to their local climate type, but both cold and hot temperatures are still associated with increased risk of mortality. Public health strategies to alleviate the impact of ambient temperatures are important, in particular in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Background Heatwaves are a critical public health problem. There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves under changing climate. However, evidence about the impacts of climate change on heatwave-related mortality at a global scale is limited. Methods and findings We collected historical daily time series of mean temperature and mortality for all causes or nonexternal causes, in periods ranging from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 2015, in 412 communities within 20 countries/regions. We estimated heatwave–mortality associations through a two-stage time series design. Current and future daily mean temperature series were projected under four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 1971–2099, with five general circulation models. We projected excess mortality in relation to heatwaves in the future under each scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, with two assumptions for adaptation (no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation) and three scenarios of population change (high variant, median variant, and low variant). Results show that, if there is no adaptation, heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions (close to the equator), while European countries and the United States will have smaller percent increases in heatwave-related excess mortality. The higher the population variant and the greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the increase of heatwave-related excess mortality in the future. The changes in 2031–2080 compared with 1971–2020 range from approximately 2,000\% in Colombia to 150\% in Moldova under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario, without any adaptation. If we considered hypothetical adaptation to future climate, under high-variant population scenario and all scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, the heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to still increase across all the countries/regions except Moldova and Japan. However, the increase would be much smaller than the no adaptation scenario. The simple assumptions with respect to adaptation as follows: no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation results in some uncertainties of projections. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwave-related excess mortality across various regions and under alternative scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, different assumptions of adaptation, and different scenarios of population change. The projections can help decision makers in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies for climate change.},

  abstract = {Background The most direct way in which climate change is expected to affect public health relates to changes in mortality rates associated with exposure to ambient temperature. Many countries worldwide experience annual heat-related and cold-related deaths associated with current weather patterns. Future changes in climate may alter such risks. Estimates of the likely future health impacts of such changes are needed to inform public health policy on climate change in the UK and elsewhere.
Methods Time-series regression analysis was used to characterise current temperature-mortality relationships by region and age group. These were then applied to the local climate and population projections to estimate temperature-related deaths for the UK by the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Greater variability in future temperatures as well as changes in mean levels was modelled.
Results A significantly raised risk of heat-related and cold-related mortality was observed in all regions. The elderly were most at risk. In the absence of any adaptation of the population, heat-related deaths would be expected to rise by around 257\% by the 2050s from a current annual baseline of around 2000 deaths, and cold-related mortality would decline by 2\% from a baseline of around 41 000 deaths. The cold burden remained higher than the heat burden in all periods. The increased number of future temperature-related deaths was partly driven by projected population growth and ageing.
Conclusions Health protection from hot weather will become increasingly necessary, and measures to reduce cold impacts will also remain important in the UK. The demographic changes expected this century mean that the health protection of the elderly will be vital.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in developed countries was enhanced by indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals, mediated by reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-serotype pneumococci. The potential indirect protection of 10-valent PCV (PCV10) in a developing country setting is unknown. We sought to estimate the effectiveness of introduction of PCV10 in Kenya against carriage of vaccine serotypes and its effect on other bacteria.
METHODS: PCV10 was introduced into the infant vaccination programme in Kenya in January, 2011, accompanied by a catch-up campaign in Kilifi County for children aged younger than 5 years. We did annual cross-sectional carriage studies among an age-stratified, random population sample in the 2 years before and 2 years after PCV10 introduction. A nasopharyngeal rayon swab specimen was collected from each participant and was processed in accordance with WHO recommendations. Prevalence ratios of carriage before and after introduction of PCV10 were calculated by log-binomial regression.
FINDINGS: About 500 individuals were enrolled each year (total n=2031). Among children younger than 5 years, the baseline (2009-10) carriage prevalence was 34\% for vaccine-serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae, 41\% for non-vaccine-serotype Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 54\% for non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. After PCV10 introduction (2011-12), these percentages were 13\%, 57\%, and 40\%, respectively. Adjusted prevalence ratios were 0·36 (95\% CI 0·26-0·51), 1·37 (1·13-1·65), and 0·62 (0·52-0·75), respectively. Among individuals aged 5 years or older, the adjusted prevalence ratios for vaccine-serotype and non-vaccine-serotype S pneumoniae carriage were 0·34 (95\% CI 0·18-0·62) and 1·13 (0·92-1·38), respectively. There was no change in prevalence ratio for Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted prevalence ratio for those {$<$}5 years old 1·02, 95\% CI 0·52-1·99, and for those ≥5 years old 0·90, 0·60-1·35).
INTERPRETATION: After programmatic use of PCV10 in Kilifi, carriage of vaccine serotypes was reduced by two-thirds both in children younger than 5 years and in older individuals. These findings suggest that PCV10 introduction in Africa will have substantial indirect effects on invasive pneumococcal disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the performance of the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) among female sex workers (FSWs) in China. METHODS: Cervical swabs from 997 participants were blindly detected by the Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay on the automated m2000 molecular platform and Roche Cobas Amplicor CT/NG assay. Discrepant analysis were confirmed by the Qiagen care CT PCR assay. The sample was defined as candidate nvCT-positive if it was CT positive in the Abbott m2000 assay, but CT negative in the other two assays. RESULTS: 25 specimens that were discordant for CT and 26 specimens that were discordant for NG between the two assays were resolved by Qiagen care CT \& NG PCR assays. The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for Abbott m2000 assay were 92.59\% and 100\% for CT and 95.45\% and 99.90\% for NG. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of Abbott m2000 assay were100\% and 98.52\% for CT and 95.5\% and 99.90\% for NG, respectively. No candidate new-variant CT(nvCT)specimens were identified. CONCLUSION: Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay were more specify for CT and NG detection, however, its sensitivity for CT and NG were a little bit lower than Roche Cobas Amplicor CT/NG assay. Abbott RealTime CT/NG assay had higher PPV for NG detection than Roche Cobas Amplicor CT/NG assay; it would be more suitable for screening for population with low-prevalence NG. There is currently no evidence that nvCT is present in FSWs in China.},

However, increases in IPD due to other serotypes have been observed, in particular 19A. How much this "serotype replacement" will erode the benefits of vaccination and over what timescale is unknown. We used a population genetic approach to test first whether the selective impact of vaccination could be detected in a longitudinal carriage sample, and secondly how long it persisted for following introduction of vaccine in 2000. To detect the selective impact of the vaccine we compared the serotype diversity of samples from pneumococcal carriage in Massachusetts children collected in 2001, 2004 and 2007 with others collected in the pre-vaccine era in Massachusetts, the UK and Finland. The 2004 sample was significantly (p {$>$}0.0001) more diverse than pre-vaccine samples, indicating the selective pressure of vaccination. The 2007 sample showed no significant difference in diversity from the pre-vaccine period, and exhibited similar population structure, but with different serotypes. In 2007 the carriage frequency of 19A was similar to that of the most common serotype in pre-vaccine samples. We suggest that serotype replacement involving 19A may be complete in Massachusetts due to similarities in population structure to pre-vaccine samples. These results suggest that the replacement phenomenon occurs rapidly with high vaccine coverage, and may allay concerns about future increases in disease due to 19A. For other serotypes, the future course of replacement disease remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) at the population level is unclear. We explored PCV13's effect in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD)-related morbidity and mortality, and whether serotype-specific changes were attributable to vaccination or expected as a part of natural, cyclical variations.
METHODS: This was a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study based on the linkage of laboratory surveillance data and the Danish Civil Registration System. Changes in IPD incidence and mortality during baseline (2000-2007), 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) (2008-2010), and PCV13 (2011-2013) periods were estimated. Predicted incidences of serotypes were estimated controlling for cyclical trends from historical patterns observed during the past 20 years.
RESULTS: We observed a 21\% reduction (95\% confidence interval [CI], 17\%-25\%) in IPD incidence in the total population after PCV13's introduction, and a 71\% reduction (95\% CI, 62\%-79\%) in children aged {$<$}2 years, considered as the vaccine effectiveness. We estimated a 28\% reduction (95\% CI, 18\%-37\%) in IPD-related 30-day mortality, from 3.4 deaths (95\% CI, 3.2-3.6) per 100 000 population in the pre-PCV period to 2.4 (95\% CI, 2.2-2.7) in the PCV13 period. The decline in mortality was observed across all age groups but was mainly related to mortality reductions in the nonvaccinated population. For serotypes 1 and 3, there were no significant changes in incidence beyond what would be expected from natural cyclical patterns. Serotype 19A significantly increased following PCV7's introduction, but the incidence declined toward baseline in 2012.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 has brought greater benefits than we had expected in our setting. We observed a further decline on IPD incidence shortly after the shift from PCV7 to PCV13 in the national immunization program. This decline was accompanied by a substantial population-level decline in pneumococcal-related mortality of nearly 30\% among nonvaccinated persons.},

Despite its growing popularity, there is a scarcity of guidance on power and sample size considerations within the ITS framework. Our aim here was to assess the statistical power to detect an intervention effect under various real life ITS scenarios. ITS datasets were created using Monte-Carlo simulations to generate cumulative incidence (outcome) values over time. We generated 1,000 datasets per scenario, varying the number of time points, average sample size per time point, average relative reduction post-intervention, location of intervention in the time-series and reduction mediated via a: (i) slope change and (ii) step change. Performance measures included power and \% bias. We found that sample size per timepoint had a large impact on power. Even in scenarios with 12 pre-intervention and 12 post-intervention timepoints with moderate intervention effect sizes, most analyses were underpowered if the sample size per timepoint was low. We conclude that various factors need to be collectively considered to ensure adequate power for an ITS study. We have demonstrated a means of providing insight on underlying sample size requirements in ordinary least squares ITS analysis based on pre-specified parameters and have developed Stata code to estimate this.},

Design Interrupted time series analyses to assess mean quarterly changes from October 1998 to the end of 2009 relative to projected deaths without the legislation based on pre-legislation trends.
Setting Mortality (1993-2009) and liver unit activity (1995-2009) in England and Wales, using information from the Office for National Statistics and NHS Blood and Transplant, respectively.
Participants Residents of England and Wales.
Main outcome measures Suicide, deaths of undetermined intent, and accidental poisoning deaths involving single drug ingestion of paracetamol and paracetamol compounds in people aged 10 years and over, and liver unit registrations and transplantations for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity.
Results Compared with the pre-legislation level, following the legislation there was an estimated average reduction of 17 (95\% confidence interval −25 to −9) deaths per quarter in England and Wales involving paracetamol alone (with or without alcohol) that received suicide or undetermined verdicts. This decrease represented a 43\% reduction or an estimated 765 fewer deaths over the 11¼ years after the legislation. A similar effect was found when accidental poisoning deaths were included, and when a conservative method of analysis was used. This decrease was largely unaltered after controlling for a non-significant reduction in deaths involving other methods of poisoning and also suicides by all methods. There was a 61\% reduction in registrations for liver transplantation for paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity (−11 (−20 to −1) registrations per quarter). But no reduction was seen in actual transplantations (−3 (−12 to 6)), nor in registrations after a conservative method of analysis was used.
Conclusions UK legislation to reduce pack sizes of paracetamol was followed by significant reductions in deaths due to paracetamol overdose, with some indication of fewer registrations for transplantation at liver units during the 11 years after the legislation. The continuing toll of deaths suggests, however, that further preventive measures should be sought.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a well-studied phenomenon, whereby urban areas are generally warmer than surrounding suburban and rural areas. The most direct effect on health from the UHI is due to heat risk, which is exacerbated in urban areas, particularly during heat waves. However, there may be health benefits from warming during colder months. This review highlights recent attempts to quantitatively estimate the health impacts of the UHI and estimations of the health benefits of UHI mitigation measures.
RECENT FINDINGS: Climate change, increasing urbanisation and an ageing population in much of the world, is likely to increase the risks to health from the UHI, particularly from heat exposure. Studies have shown increased health risks in urban populations compared with rural or suburban populations in hot weather and a disproportionate impact on more vulnerable social groups. Estimations of the impacts of various mitigation techniques suggest that a range of measures could reduce health impacts from heat and bring other benefits to health and wellbeing. The impact of the UHI on heat-related health is significant, although often overlooked, particularly when considering future impacts associated with climate change. Multiple factors should be considered when designing mitigation measures in urban environments in order to maximise health benefits and avoid unintended negative effects.},

Parameters are estimated for various diseases and are used to compare the vaccination levels necessary for herd immunity for these diseases. Although the three models presented are simple and their mathematical analyses are elementary, these models provide notation, concepts, intuition and foundation for considering more refined models. Some possible refinements are disease-related factors such as the infectious agent, mode of transmission, latent period, infectious period, susceptibility and resistance, but also social, cultural, Ecology by providing a sound intuitive understanding and complete proofs for the three most basic epidemiological models for microparasitic infections.},

Our novel Bayesian approach addresses the count data nature of the problem using negative binomial sampling and shows that right-truncation of the reporting delay distribution under an assumption of time-homogeneity can be handled in a conjugate prior-posterior framework using the generalized Dirichlet distribution. Since, in retrospect, the true number of hospitalizations is available, proper scoring rules for count data are used to evaluate and compare the predictive quality of the procedures during the outbreak. The results show that it is important to take the count nature of the time series into account and that changes in the delay distribution occurred due to intervention measures. As a consequence, we extend the Bayesian analysis to a hierarchical model, which combines a discrete time survival regression model for the delay distribution with a penalized spline for the dynamics of the epidemic curve. Altogether, we conclude that in emerging and time-critical outbreaks, nowcasting approaches are a valuable tool to gain information about current trends.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesWe previously developed a model for projection of heat-related mortality attributable to climate change. The objective of this paper is to improve the fit and precision of and examine the robustness of the model.MethodsWe obtained daily data for number of deaths and maximum temperature from respective governmental organizations of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the USA, and European countries. For future projection, we used the Bergen climate model 2 (BCM2) general circulation model, the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B socioeconomic scenario, and the mortality projection for the 65+-year-old age group developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The heat-related excess mortality was defined as follows: The temperature–mortality relation forms a V-shaped curve, and the temperature at which mortality becomes lowest is called the optimum temperature (OT). The difference in mortality between the OT and a temperature beyond the OT is the excess mortality. To develop the model for projection, we used Japanese 47-prefecture data from 1972 to 2008. Using a distributed lag nonlinear model (two-dimensional nonparametric regression of temperature and its lag effect), we included the lag effect of temperature up to 15 days, and created a risk function curve on which the projection is based. As an example, we perform a future projection using the above-mentioned risk function. In the projection, we used 1961–1990 temperature as the baseline, and temperatures in the 2030s and 2050s were projected using the BCM2 global circulation model, SRES A1B scenario, and WHO-provided annual mortality. Here, we used the “counterfactual method” to evaluate the climate change impact; For example, baseline temperature and 2030 mortality were used to determine the baseline excess, and compared with the 2030 excess, for which we used 2030 temperature and 2030 mortality. In terms of adaptation to warmer climate, we assumed 0 \% adaptation when the OT as of the current climate is used and 100 \% adaptation when the OT as of the future climate is used. The midpoint of the OTs of the two types of adaptation was set to be the OT for 50 \% adaptation.ResultsWe calculated heat-related excess mortality for 2030 and 2050.ConclusionsOur new model is considered to be better fit, and more precise and robust compared with the previous model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases remain a leading cause of vaccine-preventable death worldwide in children {$<$}5 years of age. The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was approved in 2001 in Europe and was introduced into the national immunization programmes of many European countries from 2006-2008. In 2009, higher-valent PCVs (PCV10 and PCV13) became available, replacing PCV7 from 2009-2011. This article describes the evolution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) following the introduction of PCVs in Western Europe, based on data from publicly-available medical publications and national surveillance systems from January 2010 to May 2015.
DISCUSSION: In countries with high vaccine uptake, 5-7 years after PCV7 introduction IPD caused by vaccine serotypes has almost disappeared in children. Non-PCV7 serotypes have emerged, particularly serotypes 19A, 7 F, 3 and 1. A rapid and significant reduction of the additional serotypes included in higher-valent vaccines has been observed consistently following the introduction of these vaccines. A significant and rapid decline of serotypes 19A, 7 F, 1 and 6A in both vaccine-eligible and older age groups has been observed in countries using PCV13 while serotype 19A and 3 has increased in countries using PCV10. Serotype 3 has become one of the most prevalent serotypes in adults, with some reduction only in the UK and France. Serotype diversity increased and varied by age group, the type of vaccine in use, and the time since the introduction of higher-valent PCVs. Serotypes that are currently more frequent include 24 F, 22 F, 8 and 15A in countries that use PCV13, and serotypes 19A and 3 in countries that use PCV10. Compared with the time before the introduction of higher valent PCVs, to date, there is no single '19A-like' serotype emerging across countries and most of the newly emerging non-PCV13 vaccine types are less invasive with a low case-carrier ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to closely monitor not only evolving serotypes but also the magnitude of the effect in order to evaluate the overall impact of pneumococcal vaccination programmes and to initiate the appropriate vaccination strategy. Emerging serotypes may also need to be considered for the future development of new vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heat-related mortality is a matter of great public health concern, especially in the light of climate change. Although many studies have found associations between high temperatures and mortality, more research is needed to project the future impacts of climate change on heat-related mortality.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review of research and methods for projecting future heat-related mortality under climate change scenarios.
DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: A literature search was conducted in August 2010, using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, and Web of Science. The search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from January 1980 through July 2010.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most projections showed that climate change would result in a substantial increase in heat-related mortality. Projecting heat-related mortality requires understanding historical temperature-mortality relationships and considering the future changes in climate, population, and acclimatization. Further research is needed to provide a stronger theoretical framework for projections, including a better understanding of socioeconomic development, adaptation strategies, land-use patterns, air pollution, and mortality displacement.
CONCLUSIONS: Scenario-based projection research will meaningfully contribute to assessing and managing the potential impacts of climate change on heat-related mortality.},

This secondary analysis uses data abstracted from the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey 1999-2000 to report prevalence rates of two STIs as well as sexual risk behaviors for CFSWs - men who paid for sex with FSWs in the past 12 months - in comparison with men who had not patronized FSWs. Among 1879 Chinese CFSWs who completed anonymous interviews and urine testing, 152 (6.3\%, weighted) said they had paid for sex in the past 12 months and 18.8\% of CFSWs (weighted) tested positive for gonorrhea. CFSWs were 10 times more likely to have an STI (either self-reported or tested) than non-client Chinese men, and they were equally likely to use condoms inconsistently with their spouses. This study highlights the importance of studying CFSWs who use condoms inconsistently and do not practice safe sex with their spouse as a potential bridge population. Prevention and intervention efforts should target this bridge population and include education on HIV/AIDS and STI transmission, condom promotion, marriage counseling, destigmatization of HIV and STIs, and promotion of STI diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {SummaryBACKGROUND: The hot summer of 2003 brought about increased mortality in southern and western Europe, highlighting the health impact of heatwaves. No Austrian mortality data have yet been reported for this summer period. METHODS: Daily mortality data for Vienna between 1998 and 2004 were obtained from Statistics Austria and meteorological data from the Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics. Heatwaves were defined using the Kysely criterion. Daily mortality for May to September was predicted by a generalized additive model considering over-dispersion with Poisson deviates and a log link. Seasonal trend was accounted for by a natural spline, weekdays were modeled by dummy variables and heatwave days were included as dichotomous predictor. RESULTS: The average seasonal temperature for May to September in Vienna has increased by more than 1.7 °C during the last 35 years. In 2003 there was an excess of heatwave days, 44 overall, that resulted in an increased number of deaths, approximately 180, most of which were not due to 'harvesting'. Heatwave days between 1998 and 2004 were associated with a significantly increased relative mortality risk of 1.13 [95\% confidence interval 1.09–1.17]. This increase was stronger in females than in males. Although excess mortality was seen in all age groups, it reached significance only in the elderly population over 65 years. DISCUSSION: An impact of heatwaves on mortality was apparent in Vienna, although not as pronounced as in France and south-western Europe. In 2003 at least 130 heatwave-related deaths in Vienna could have been avoided by prompt medical assistance and proper advice about how to cope with excessive thermal conditions. Preventive programs are warranted during heatwaves, especially to target elderly people, because the likelihood of heatwaves as a consequence of global warming is increasing.},

We found a V-like relationship between mortality and temperature, with an optimum temperature value (e.g., average temperature with lowest mortality rate) of 16.5 degrees C for total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, and mortality among those [Greater and equal to] 65 year of age. For mortality due to malignant neoplasms and mortality in the youngest age group, the optimum temperatures were 15.5 degrees C and 14.5 degrees C, respectively. For temperatures above the optimum, mortality increased by 0.47, 1.86, 12.82, and 2.72\% for malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and total mortality, respectively, for each degree Celsius increase above the optimum in the preceding month. For temperatures below the optimum, mortality increased 0.22, 1.69, 5.15, and 1.37\%, respectively, for each degree Celsius decrease below the optimum in the preceding month. Mortality increased significantly during all of the heat waves studied, and the elderly were most effected by extreme heat. The heat waves led to increases in mortality due to all of the selected causes, especially respiratory mortality. Average total excess mortality during the heat waves studied was 12.1\%, or 39.8 deaths/day. The average excess mortality during the cold spells was 12.8\% or 46.6 deaths/day, which was mostly attributable to the increase in cardiovascular mortality and mortality among the elderly. The results concerning the forward displacement of deaths due to heat waves were not conclusive. We found no cold-induced forward displacement of deaths.},

This scenario-based integrated health impacts assessment explores baseline (1981-2010) and future (2050) population attributable fractions (PAF) of mortality due to heat (PAFheat) and cold (PAFcold), by combining observed temperature-mortality relationships with the Dutch KNMI'14 climate scenarios and three adaptation scenarios. The 2050 model results without adaptation reveal a decrease in PAFcold (8.90\% at baseline; 6.56\%-7.85\% in 2050) that outweighs the increase in PAFheat (1.15\% at baseline; 1.66\%-2.52\% in 2050). When the 2050 model runs applying the different adaptation scenarios are considered as well, however, the PAFheat ranges between 0.94\% and 2.52\% and the PAFcold between 6.56\% and 9.85\%. Hence, PAFheat and PAFcold can decrease as well as increase in view of climate change (depending on the adaptation scenario). The associated annual mortality burdens in 2050-accounting for both the increasing temperatures and mortality trend-show that heat-related deaths will range between 1879 and 5061 (1511 at baseline) and cold-related deaths between 13,149 and 19,753 (11,727 at baseline). Our results clearly illustrate that model outcomes are not only highly dependent on climate scenarios, but also on adaptation assumptions. Hence, a better understanding of (the impact of various) plausible adaptation scenarios is required to advance future integrated health impact assessments.},

The susceptibles are divided into n groups based on their susceptibilities, and the infectives are divided into m groups according to their infectivities.

We define the reproductive number for each subgroup. Then the reproductive number for the entire population is a weighted average of those reproductive numbers for the subgroups. The formulas for the reproductive number are derived from the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium. We show that the infection-free equilibrium is globally stable as the reproductive number is less than one for the models with the bilinear incidence or with the standard incidence but no disease-induced death. We then show that if the reproductive number is greater than one, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium for these models. For the general cases of the models with the standard incidence and death, conditions are derived to ensure the uniqueness of the endemic equilibrium. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate that the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if it exists.},

Introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into routine infant immunization programs worldwide resulted in serotype 19A becoming a leading cause of the remaining pneumococcal disease burden in vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. This article reviews the impact of the latest generation PCVs (10-valent PCV, PCV10, and 13-valent PCV, PCV13) on serotype 19A. Areas covered: This article covers immune responses elicited by PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 against serotype 19A and their impact on nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage and disease in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations using data from surveillance systems, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. Expert commentary: As expected from a PCV containing serotype 19A, PCV13 elicits significantly higher functional immune responses against serotype 19A than PCV7 and PCV10. Higher responses are likely to be linked to both direct impact in vaccinated populations and reductions in 19A NP carriage in children, thus inducing herd protection and reducing 19A invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in nonvaccinated children and adults. In contrast, PCV7 and PCV10 have shown mixed evidence of direct short-lived cross-protection and little to no impact on 19A carriage, resulting in continued transmission and disease.},

  abstract = {As a way of facilitating a positive development with regard to adaptation, all refugees are expected to go through the foreign language training programme as soon as possible after settlement. This is seen as a way to help refugees gain a greater participation in the host society. The current study aimed at evaluating the role of trauma and psychological distress on motivation for foreign language acquisition among refugees. A total of 12 schools participated in the study. The schools were situated in Middle of Norway. In all, 239 questionnaires were handed out, of which 191 (80\%) were completed. It was found that, the most violent traumatic events seem to be negatively related with motivation for foreign language acquisition. Coping strategies came out as a positive predictor of motivation for language training. Continent of origin appears to make a difference, showing that Asian refugees were more motivated for language acquisition than Africans. The current study suggests that refugees' past traumatic experiences influence their motivation to learn a foreign language. If successful foreign language acquisition is to be achieved, the refugees must be given the opportunity to deal with their traumatic past while embarking on acquisition of foreign language.},

The ubiquity of this trend, however, remains unexamined. In an attempt to paint a global picture, we used case counts to determine which countries experienced statistically significant trends in incidence over the past two decades and to map changes in incidence during this period. These data reveal that pertussis resurgence is not a universal phenomenon. The heterogeneity in incidence trends, even in countries with superficially similar demography, socioeconomic conditions and vaccination programmes, is striking and requires explanation. In this opinion piece, we review and assess the multifaceted proposed explanations incorporating evolution, population dynamics, and the details of immunization programmes. While we do not solve the riddle that is pertussis epidemiology, we highlight critical aspects that are likely to hold the key to understanding its worldwide epidemiology.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We completed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science, and reference lists to identify English language articles through to December 2013 that used interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research. We tabulated the number of studies by publication year and summarized methodological detail.
RESULTS: We identified 220 eligible empirical applications since 1984. Only 17 (8\%) were published before 2000, and 90 (41\%) were published since 2010. Segmented regression was the most commonly applied interrupted time series method (67\%). Most studies assessed drug policy changes (51\%, n = 112); 22\% (n = 48) examined the impact of new evidence, 18\% (n = 39) examined safety advisories, and 16\% (n = 35) examined quality improvement interventions. Autocorrelation was considered in 66\% of studies, 31\% reported adjusting for seasonality, and 15\% accounted for nonstationarity.
CONCLUSION: Use of interrupted time series methods in drug utilization research has increased, particularly in recent years. Despite methodological recommendations, there is large variation in reporting of analytic methods. Developing methodological and reporting standards for interrupted time series analysis is important to improve its application in drug utilization research, and we provide recommendations for consideration.},

  abstract = {Background
The ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the Finnish National Vaccination Program (NVP) in September 2010 with a 2+1 schedule (3, 5, 12 months) without catch-up vaccinations. We evaluated the direct and indirect effects of PCV10 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among children ≤5 years of age during the first three years after NVP introduction.

Methods
We conducted a population-based, observational follow-up study. The cohort of vaccine-eligible children (all children born June 1, 2010 or later) was followed from 3 months of age until the end of 2013. For the indirect effect, another cohort of older children ineligible for PCV10 vaccination was followed from 2011 through 2013. Both cohorts were compared with season- and age-matched reference cohorts before NVP introduction. National, population-based laboratory surveillance data were used to compare culture-confirmed serotype-specific IPD rates in the vaccine target and reference cohorts by using Poisson regression models.

Results
The overall IPD rate among vaccine-eligible children was reduced by 80\% (95\%CI 72 to 85); the reduction in vaccine-type IPD was 92\% (95\%CI 86 to 95). However, a non-significant increase in non-vaccine type IPD was observed. During 2012–2013, we also observed a 48\% (95\%CI 18 to 69) reduction in IPD among unvaccinated children 2 to 5 years of age, which was mostly attributable to the ten vaccine serotypes.

Conclusions
This is the first population-based study investigating the impact of PCV10 introduction without prior PCV7 use. A substantial decrease in IPD rates among vaccine-eligible children was observed. A smaller and temporally delayed reduction among older, unvaccinated children suggests that PCV10 also provides indirect protection against vaccine-type IPD. Changes in serotype distribution warrant continuous monitoring of potential increases in non-vaccine serotypes.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees (“who infected whom”) from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health impacts of heat waves are serious and have prompted the development of heat wave response plans. Even when they are efficient, these plans are developed to limit the health effects of heat waves. This study was designed to determine relevant indicators related to health effects of heat waves and to evaluate the ability of a syndromic surveillance system to monitor variations in the activity of emergency departments over time. The study uses data collected during the summer 2006 when a new heat wave occurred in France.
METHODS: Data recorded from 49 emergency departments since July 2004, were transmitted daily via the Internet to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance. Items collected on patients included diagnosis (ICD10 codes), outcome, and age. Statistical t-tests were used to compare, for several health conditions, the daily averages of patients within different age groups and periods (whether 'on alert' or 'off alert').
RESULTS: A limited number of adverse health conditions occurred more frequently during hot period: dehydration, hyperthermia, malaise, hyponatremia, renal colic, and renal failure. Over all health conditions, the total number of patients per day remained equal between the 'on alert' and 'off alert' periods (4,557.7/day vs. 4,511.2/day), but the number of elderly patients increased significantly during the 'on alert' period relative to the 'off alert' period (476.7/day vs. 446.2/day p {$<$} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results show the interest to monitor specific indicators during hot periods and to focus surveillance efforts on the elderly. Syndromic surveillance allowed the collection of data in real time and the subsequent optimization of the response by public health agencies. This method of surveillance should therefore be considered as an essential part of efforts to prevent the health effects of heat waves.},

Most network-based models used in epidemiology tend to ignore heterogeneity in the weighting of contacts between two individuals. However, this assumption is known to be at odds with the data for many networks (e.g. sexual contact networks) and to have a critical influence on epidemics' behavior. One of the reasons why models usually ignore heterogeneity in transmission is that we currently lack tools to analyze weighted networks, such that most studies rely on numerical simulations. Here, we present a novel framework to estimate key epidemiological variables, such as the rate of early epidemic expansion (r0) and the basic reproductive ratio (R0), from joint probability distributions of number of partners (contacts) and number of interaction events through which contacts are weighted. These distributions are much easier to infer than the exact shape of the network, which makes the approach widely applicable. The framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course of epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour, which we validate with numerical simulations on networks. Overall, incorporating more realistic contact networks into epidemiological models can improve our understanding of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases.},

Sizeable outbreaks of pertussis have been reported over the past 5 years, and disease reemergence has been the focus of international attention to develop a deeper understanding of pathogen virulence and genetic evolution of B. pertussis strains. During the past 20 years, the scientific community has recognized pertussis among adults as well as infants and children. Increased recognition that older children and adolescents are at risk for disease and may transmit B. pertussis to younger siblings has underscored the need to better understand the role of innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immunity, including the role of waning immunity. Although recognition of adult pertussis has increased in tandem with a better understanding of B. pertussis pathogenesis, pertussis in neonates and adults can manifest with atypical clinical presentations. Such disease patterns make pertussis recognition difficult and lead to delays in treatment. Ongoing research using newer tools for molecular analysis holds promise for improved understanding of pertussis epidemiology, bacterial pathogenesis, bioinformatics, and immunology. Together, these advances provide a foundation for the development of new-generation diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake devastated several power stations and caused severe electricity shortages. This accident was followed by the implementation of policies to reduce summer electricity consumption in the affected areas, for example, by limiting air-conditioning (AC) use. This provided a natural experimental scenario to investigate if these policies were associated with an increase in heat-related mortality.
OBJECTIVES: We examined whether the reduced electricity consumption in warm season modified heat-related mortality from 2008 to 2012.
METHODS: We conducted prefecture-specific interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses to compare temperature-mortality associations before and after the earthquake, and used meta-analysis to generate combined effect estimates for the most affected and less affected areas (prefectures with or reductions in electricity consumption, respectively). We then examined whether the temperature-mortality association in Tokyo, one of the most affected areas, was modified by the percent reduction in electricity consumption relative to expected consumption for comparable days before the earthquake.
RESULTS: Contrary to expectations, we estimated a 5-9\% reduction in all-cause heat-related mortality after the earthquake in the 15 prefectures with the greatest reduction in electricity consumption, and little change in the other prefectures. However, the percent reduction in observed vs. expected daily electricity consumption after the earthquake did not significantly modify daily heat-related mortality in Tokyo.
CONCLUSIONS: In the prefectures with the greatest reductions in electricity consumption, heat-related mortality decreased rather than increased following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Additional research is needed to determine whether this finding holds for other populations and regions, and to clarify its implications for policies to reduce the consequences of climate change on health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP493.},

This article will describe the rationale for the vaccine and its potential role to significantly decrease mortality and morbidity of meningococcal disease in those areas and populations at greatest risk from these serogroups.},

  abstract = {The distribution of overall temperature and the frequency of heat waves may be shifting due to climate change. However, forecasting future health consequences of higher temperatures in a given city is complicated by uncertainties in how populations and societal infrastructure will adapt. This paper reviews approaches to address these challenges, including: (1) using historical weather–mortality relationships for the same region, or a location with a similar climate as the city of interest; (2) evaluating adaptation using the minimum mortality threshold (MMT) temperature (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate); and (3) estimating the impact of modifiers (e.g., air conditioning, population density, green space) on the temperature and mortality relation, and then predicting a range of effects based on plausible estimates for the future values of these parameters in a given city. Each approach can provide insight into how heat could affect mortality under a changing climate, but all have uncertainties. In spite of these limitations, projecting the future public health burden of temperature-related health effects can provide valuable information to aid public health and environmental authorities in planning and communicating the risks of climate change to the public.},

On 25~February, two cases imported from Italy were diagnosed in Innsbruck but again no secondary cases were identified in Austria. The first three infections of Austrian inhabitants were detected on 27~February in Vienna. The two resulting clusters finally included 6 (source of initial infection unknown) and 61~cases. Most likely, Italy was the source of the latter cluster. On 12~March the first fatal case of COVID-19 in Austria was reported, a~69-year-old Viennese who died in a~Vienna hospital after returning from a~cruise ship tour in Italy. On 6~March three autochthonously acquired cases were reported in the Tyrol, all related to the ski resort Ischgl. Of the first 14~Islandic COVID-19 cases infected in Ischgl, 11~had already returned to Iceland on 29~February. We consider that the incriminated barkeeper, who tested PCR positive on 7~March, was neither the primary case nor a~superspreader. In our opinion, undetected transmission of SARS-CoV‑2 had been ongoing in Ischgl prior to the first laboratory confirmed cases. Our data also underline that the introduction of SARS-CoV‑2 into Austria was not one single event.},

The model is based on a stochastic pair formation and separation process, which describes the underlying structure of the sexual contact pattern. It is implemented as a Monte Carlo simulation model. Spread of the STDs was modeled in an age-structured heterosexual population with a highly sexually active core group. Contact tracing strategies, screening of various subgroups, and the effect of condom use were compared. The authors conclude that contact tracing is very effective as a prevention strategy, that screening should be targeted to the highly active core group, that age is not sufficient as a determinant for high sexual activity to make screening of certain age groups useful, and, finally, that consistent condom use by a fraction of the population can contribute substantially to the prevention of STDs. All strategies proved more effective for gonorrhea than for chlamydia prevention, which may explain the relatively high prevalence of chlamydia found in many heterosexual populations.

  abstract = {Pertussis or whooping cough has been given many names over the centuries. It was first recognized in the Middle Ages and since then various epidemics have been described. Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou isolated Bordetella pertussis, a causative agent for whooping cough, in Paris more than 100 years ago, which created an excellent opportunity to invent a vaccine. In 1914 the whole-cell pertussis vaccine was invented, then in the 1940s it was combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to become DTP and it became widely available. A successive decrease in the incidence of the disease has since been observed. The vaccine has been about 80\,\% effective in preventing serious disease and death from pertussis. The disadvantage is that the vaccine offers protection for 5-10 years after the last dose of the full vaccination course. The second issue is the question of how to prevent side effects of the whole-cell vaccine. In the 1990s, the acellular vaccine was introduced in the US and gradually replaced the whole-cell vaccine. About 10 years later, a possible failure with the new vaccine has been observed, that is a lack of long-term protection. Nowadays, both vaccines are used, with the acellular vaccine being vastly predominant in most developed countries. Pertussis incidence has increased since the 1980s, but new prevention strategies include booster doses for specific age groups.},

  abstract = {Human immunity influences the evolution and impact of influenza strains. Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime, and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants’ histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We find that individual-level influenza antibody profiles can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses alongside infection history can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions of seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for quantifying aspects of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations. This approach to analysing multiple timescales for antigenic responses could also be applied to other multistrain pathogens such as dengue and related flaviviruses.},

Rates of severe injury during the period from 1983 to 1991 among children under the age of 17 years living in Central Harlem and in the neighboring community of Washington Heights are analyzed. The two methods provide similar point estimates of the effect of the intervention and have a good fit to the data. Although time series analysis has been promoted as the method of choice in analysis of sequential observations over long periods of time, this illustration suggests that Poisson regression is an attractive and viable alternative.

  abstract = {SummaryIn Austria, a country with a total population of approximately 8.3 million, the published estimates of influenza-associated deaths within the past decade are surprisingly high (up to 6000 deaths per year) when compared to neighbouring countries. The objective of our analysis was to provide reliable estimates of the annual influenza-related deaths in Austria. We estimated the seasonal influenza-related excess mortality by calculating the difference between all-cause mortality observed during the influenza season and the baseline values to be expected during that time span if increased influenza activity was absent. Increased influenza activity was defined as moderate, usual or high, categorized by the influenza activity index using weekly data from the Austrian sentinel clinical surveillance system. For obtaining estimates of baseline all-cause mortality, a cyclic regression model was applied to the time series data on weekly all-cause mortality from 2001 to 2009. Austrian seasonal influenza-related excess mortality peaked in the seasons 2002/2003 (1060 excess deaths), 2004/2005 (1102 excess deaths) and 2008/2009 (1192 excess deaths). The rising trend observed is in parallel with the increasing proportion of the Austrian population older than 65 years for the same time span (2001:15.5\%; 2009: 17.5\%). Our findings on seasonal influenza-related excess mortality are in accordance with the estimates from Germany and Switzerland, which were derived from a similar approach. In order to gain and to preserve higher compliance with influenza vaccination initiatives, it is essential to have reliable data on influenza-related mortality. Thus, the numbers presented so far by Austrian public health institutions must be challenged.},

Based on rapid uptake (32~600 people initiated DAA in 2016), we estimated the impact on HCV epidemiology and mortality in Australia and determined if Australia can meet the WHO HCV elimination targets by 2030. Using a mathematical model, we simulated pessimistic, intermediate and optimistic DAA treatment scenarios in Australia over 2016-2030. We assumed treatment and testing rates were initially higher for advanced fibrosis and the same across HCV transmission risk level sub-populations. We also assumed constant testing rates after 2016. We compared the results to the 2015 level and a counterfactual (IFN-based) scenario. During 2016-2030, we estimated an intermediate DAA treatment scenario (2016, 32~600 treated; 2017, 21~370 treated; 2018~17~100 treated; 2019 and beyond, 13~680 treated each year) would avert 40~420 new HCV infections, 13~260 liver-related deaths (15~320 in viraemic; -2060 in cured) and 10~730 HCC cases, equating to a 53\%, 63\% and 75\% reduction, respectively, compared to the IFN-based scenario. The model also estimated that Australia will meet the WHO targets of incidence and treatment by 2028. Time to a 65\% reduction in liver-related mortality varied considerably between HCV viraemic only cases (2026) and all cases (2047). Based on a feasible DAA treatment scenario incorporating declining uptake, Australia should meet key WHO HCV elimination targets in 10 to15~years. The pre-DAA escalation in those with advanced liver disease makes the achievement of the liver-related mortality target difficult.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have substantially reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes; however, replacement disease with non-PCV serotypes remains a concern. We describe the population effect of the seven-valent and 13-valent PCVs (PCV7 and PCV13) on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales.
METHODS: Using national invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance data for 2016/17, we compared incidence rate ratios (IRRs) against pre-PCV13 (2008/09-2009/10) and pre-PCV7 (2000/01-2005/06) baselines. We also estimated the number of invasive pneumococcal disease cases prevented since the introduction of PCVs.
FINDINGS: In 2016/17, overall invasive pneumococcal disease incidence (9·87 cases per 100\hphantom{,}000; 5450 cases) across all age groups was 37\% lower (IRR 0·63, 95\% CI 0·60-0·65) than pre-PCV7 incidence (14·79 per 100\hphantom{,}000; 8167 cases) and 7\% lower (0·93; 0·89-0·97) than pre-PCV13 incidence (10·13 per 100\hphantom{,}000; 5595 cases). By 2016/17, PCV7-type invasive pneumococcal disease incidence across all age groups had decreased by 97\% (0·24 per 100\hphantom{,}000; 0·03, 0·02-0·04) compared with the pre-PCV7 period, whereas additional PCV13-type invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 64\% (1·66 per 100\hphantom{,}000; 0·36, 0·32-0·40) since the introduction of PCV13. Invasive pneumococcal disease incidence due to non-PCV13 serotypes doubled (7·97 per 100\hphantom{,}000; 1·97, 1·86-2·09) since the introduction of PCV7, and accelerated since 2013/14-especially serotypes 8, 12F, and 9N, which were responsible for more than 40\% of invasive pneumococcal disease cases by 2016/17. Invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in children younger than 5 years remained stable since 2013/14, with nearly all replacement disease occurring in adults. We estimated 38\hphantom{,}366 invasive pneumococcal disease cases were prevented in the 11 years since the introduction of PCV7.
INTERPRETATION: Both PCV7 and PCV13 have had a major effect in reducing the burden of invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales; however, rapid increases in some non-PCV13 serotypes are compromising the benefits of the programme.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greece was one of the countries hit the hardest by the 2008 financial crisis in Europe. Yet, evidence on the effect of the crisis on total and cause-specific mortality remains unclear. We explored whether the economic crisis affected the trend of overall and cause-specific mortality rates.
METHODS: We used regional panel data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority to assess mortality trends by age, sex, region, and cause in Greece between January, 2001, and December, 2013. We used Eurostat data to calculate monthly age-standardised mortality rates per 100\hphantom{,}000 inhabitants for each region. Data were divided into two subperiods: before the crisis (January, 2001, to August, 2008) and after the onset of the crisis (September, 2008, to December, 2013). We tested for changes in the slope of mortality by doing an interrupted time-series analysis.
FINDINGS: Overall mortality continued to decline after the onset of the financial crisis (-0·065, 95\% CI -0·080 to -0·049), but at a slower pace than before the crisis (-0·13, -0·15 to -0·10; trend difference 0·062, 95\% CI 0·041 to 0·083; p{$<$}0·0001). The trend difference was more evident for females (0·087, 95\% CI 0·064-0·11; p{$<$}0·0001) than for males (0·040, 0·013-0·066; p=0·007). Those aged at least 75 years experienced more negative effects (trend difference 0·056, 95\% CI 0·042 to 0·071; p{$<$}0·0001) than did those aged 20-34 years, in whom mortality trends improved (-0·0074, -0·0089 to -0·0059; p{$<$}0·0001). Deaths by diseases of the circulatory system declined more slowly after the onset of compared with before the crisis (trend difference 0·043, 95\% CI 0·024 to 0·063; p{$<$}0·0001), whereas deaths from vehicular accidents declined faster (-0·0062, -0·0090 to -0·0033; p{$<$}0·0001), most prominently among men aged 20-34 years (-0·0065, -0·0085 to -0·0044; p{$<$}0·0001). Conversely, deaths from suicides (trend difference 0·0021, 95\% CI 0·00092-0·0033; p=0·002), diseases of the nervous system (0·0036, 0·0016-0·0056; p=0·002), and mental health problems (0·00073, 0·000047-0·0014 p=0·038) increased after the onset of the crisis. Also, deaths due to adverse events during medical treatment increased significantly after the onset of the crisis (trend difference 0·0020, 95\% CI 0·0012-0·0028; p{$<$}0·0001). By comparing the expected values of the period after the onset of the crisis with extrapolated values based on the period before the crisis, we estimate that an extra 242 deaths per month occurred after the onset of the crisis.
INTERPRETATION: Mortality trends have been interrupted after the onset of compared with before the crisis, but changes vary by age, sex, and cause of death. The increase in deaths due to adverse events during medical treatment might reflect the effects of deterioration in quality of care during economic recessions.

  abstract = {Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a model for count data with excess zeros. It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(λ) random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(λ) distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects λ in the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and λ are unrelated; other times p is a simple function of λ such as p=1/(1+λ \textsuperscript{τ}) for an unknown constant τ. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.},

The key question is why? While several known factors such as waning of immunity, detection bias due to more sensitive tests and higher awareness of the disease among practitioners, and evolutionary shifts among B. pertussis all likely contribute, collectively, these do not adequately explain the existing epidemiologic data, suggesting that additional factors also contribute. Key amongst these is recent data indicating that the immune responses induced by aP vaccines differ fundamentally from those induced by the whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccines, and do not lead to mucosal immunity. If so, it appears likely that differences in how the two categories of vaccines work, may be pivotal to our overall understanding of the pertussis resurgence.},

  abstract = {Incidence of whooping cough, unlike many other childhood diseases for which there is an efficacious vaccine, has been increasing over the past twenty years despite high levels of vaccine coverage. Its reemergence has been particularly noticeable among teenagers and adults. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain these two patterns, but parsimonious reconciliation of clinical data on the limited duration of immunity with both pre- and postvaccine era age-specific incidence remains a challenge. We consider the immunologically relevant, yet epidemiologically largely neglected, possibility that a primed immune system can respond to a lower dose of antigen than a naive one. We hypothesize that during the prevaccine era teenagers' and adults' primed immunity was frequently boosted by reexposure, so maintaining herd immunity in the face of potentially eroding individual immunity. In contrast, low pathogen circulation in the current era, except during epidemic outbreaks, allows immunity to be lost before reexposure occurs. We develop and analyze an age-structured model that encapsulates this hypothesis. We find that immune boosting must be more easily triggered than primary infection to account for age-incidence data. We make age-specific and dynamical predictions through bifurcation analysis and simulation. The boosting model proposed here parsimoniously captures four key features of pertussis data from highly vaccinated countries: (i) the shift in age-specific incidence, (ii) reemergence with high vaccine coverage, (iii) the possibility for cyclic dynamics in the pre- and postvaccine eras, and (iv) the apparent shift from susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)-like to susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)-like phenomenology of infection and immunity to Bordetella pertussis.},

It measures the proportional reduction in disease probability when a risk factor is eliminated from the population, accounting for effects of confounding and effect-modification by nuisance variables. The computation of asymptotic variance estimates for estimates of the adjusted attributable risk is often done by applying the delta method. Investigations on the delta method have shown, however, that the delta method generally tends to underestimate the standard error, leading to biased confidence intervals. We compare confidence intervals for the adjusted attributable risk derived by applying computer intensive methods like the bootstrap or jackknife to confidence intervals based on asymptotic variance estimates using an extensive Monte Carlo simulation and within a real data example from a cohort study in cardiovascular disease epidemiology. Our results show that confidence intervals based on bootstrap and jackknife methods outperform intervals based on asymptotic theory. Best variants of computer intensive confidence intervals are indicated for different situations.},

The incidence time series exhibit many low integers as well as zero counts requiring an intrinsically stochastic modeling approach. In order to capture the stochastic nature of the transitions between the compartmental populations in such a model we specify appropriate conditional binomial distributions. In addition, a relatively simple temporally varying transmission rate function is introduced that allows for the effect of control interventions. We develop Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference that are used to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over state variables of the model, which are unobserved. This provides a realistic stochastic model that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of the disease and the effect of control interventions.},

  abstract = {Unlike for many other respiratory infections, the seasonality of pertussis is not well understood. While evidence of seasonal fluctuations in pertussis incidence has been noted in some countries, there have been conflicting findings including in the context of Australia. We investigated this issue by analysing the seasonality of pertussis notifications in Australia using monthly data from January 1991 to December 2016. Data were made available for all states and territories in Australia except for the Australian Capital Territory and were stratified into age groups. Using a time-series decomposition approach, we formulated a generalised additive model where seasonality is expressed using cosinor terms to estimate the amplitude and peak timing of pertussis notifications in Australia. We also compared these characteristics across different jurisdictions and age groups. We found evidence that pertussis notifications exhibit seasonality, with peaks observed during the spring and summer months (November–January) in Australia and across different states and territories. During peak months, notifications are expected to increase by about 15\% compared with the yearly average. Peak notifications for children {$<$}5 years occurred 1–2 months later than the general population, which provides support to the theory that older household members remain an important source of pertussis infection for younger children. In addition, our results provide a more comprehensive spatial picture of seasonality in Australia, a feature lacking in previous studies. Finally, our findings suggest that seasonal forcing may be useful to consider in future population transmission models of pertussis.},

An advantage of the design, compared to traditional case-control studies, is that risk ratios can easily be obtained directly from the cross-product of exposed and unexposed cases and controls (rare disease assumption is not required). We illustrate this in the context of point source gastrointestinal outbreaks and in field studies on vaccine effectiveness. The design is also useful to investigate multiple outcomes with a unique sample of controls or to test hypotheses when different case-definitions (from the most sensitive to the most specific) are used for a particular outcome.

  abstract = {CONTEXT AND AIMS: Vaccination with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was recommended in France in 2003 for children {$<$}2 years. The 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in 2010. We assessed the impact of PCVs vaccination on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in French children (0-15 years) and adults ({$>$}15 years).
METHODS: IPD rates were calculated using cases reported from 2001 to 2012 to Epibac, a laboratory network. The distribution of serotypes was assessed from invasive isolates serotyped at the National reference Centre for Pneumococci. IPD incidence rates were compared between the pre-PCV7 (2001-2002), late PCV7 (2008-2009) and post PCV13 (2012) periods.
RESULTS: The PCVs coverage increased from 56\% in the 2004 birth-cohort to 94\% in the 2008 and following birth-cohorts. Following PCV7 introduction, IPD incidence decreased by 19\% between 2001-2002 and 2008-2009 in children {$<$}2 years, but increased in children aged 2-15 years and adults, despite a sharp decline in PCV7-IPD in all age-groups. After PCV13 introduction, IPD incidence decreased by 34\% in children {$<$}5 years, by 50\% in those aged 5-15 years and 15\% in adults from 2008-2009 to 2012. The incidence of PCV13-Non PCV7-IPD decreased by 74\% in children {$<$}5 years and by 60\% in those aged 5-15 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with PCV13 was rapidly followed by a decrease in the incidence of all-type IPD in children, in relation with a sharp decrease in the incidence of PCV13-Non PCV7-IPD. Moreover, all-type IPD decreased after PCV13 introduction in older non-vaccinated age-groups, with a shift in the distribution of serotypes. Considering the whole 2001-2012 period, the vaccination with PCV7 and PCV13 resulted in a decline in the incidence of IPD in children up to the age of 5 but not in older children and adults.},

METHODS: An outbreak case was defined as a student or staff member with diarrhoea or vomiting that developed between January 7 and 13. Details on food exposure were collected via a self-administered questionnaire; risk ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Norovirus from the stool specimens of cases and asymptomatic kebab restaurant workers were genotyped.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight cases were identified among 144 persons (attack rate 19\%). The outbreak emerged and peaked on January 9, and ended on January 12. Compared to those who did not eat kebab, those who ate kebab on 7, 8, and 9 January were respectively 11 (95\% CI 4.2-28), 6.7 (95\% CI 3.4-13), and 9.3 (95\% CI 4.0-22) times more likely to develop disease within the following 2 days. Stool specimens from three cases and three restaurant workers were positive for norovirus GII.P21.
CONCLUSIONS: The kebab prepared by norovirus-positive restaurant workers was the most likely source of the outbreak. It is recommended that food handlers comply strictly with hand hygiene and avoid bare-handed contact with ready-to-eat food to minimize the risk of food-borne infection.},

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) are known to provide protection against vaccine serotype pneumococcal pneumonia; uncertainty exists regarding the optimum PCV dosing schedule.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) documenting the effect of PCV dosing schedules on clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema among children of ages targeted to receive vaccine. Data on 2- and 3-dose schedules were included. Percent change of pneumonia incidence rates from baseline to most recent year post-PCV introduction was calculated.
RESULTS: We identified 42 primary citations that evaluated PCV schedules and pneumonia. Thirty-seven (88\%) were from North America, Europe or Australia; 37 (88\%) evaluated PCV7 and 1 (2\%) PCV10. Two studies (both observational) compared multiple schedules within the study. We found evidence of reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia incidence for all schedules, including 2+1 (1 nonrandomized trial, 5 observational studies), 3+0 (5 randomized trials, 2 observational studies) and 3+1 (5 clinical trials, 24 observational studies) schedules. The magnitude of disease impact did not differ among schedules. Evidence for impact on pneumococcal pneumonia and empyema varied.
CONCLUSIONS: All schedules (2+1, 3+0 and 3+1) reduced clinical and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Quantifying differences in pneumonia disease impact between schedules was difficult due to heterogeneity among studies in design, case definition and population. These findings support World Health Organization recommendations for 3-dose schedules administered as either 3+0 or 2+1 regimens. Pneumonia impact data are still needed on expanded serotype PCV products, developing country settings and the role for a booster dose.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries. The effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, and mortality needs to be evaluated.
OBJECTIVES: To update the 2004 review on the efficacy of PCVs in preventing vaccine-serotypes IPD (VT-IPD) , X-ray defined pneumonia among HIV-1 negative children, and other new outcomes.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1990 to Week 4 February 2009); and EMBASE (1974 to March 2009).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCV with placebo, or another vaccine, in children under two with IPD and clinical / radiographic pneumonia as outcomes.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently identified studies, extracted data, and evaluated their corresponding risks of bias. Differences were resolved by discussion. Meta-analysis used the inverse variance method.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 publications from six RCTs conducted in Africa, US, Philippines and Finland where 57,015 children received PCV; while 56,029 received placebo or another vaccine. Seven publications provided high quality evidence on PCV efficacy against IPD and four provided moderate quality evidence against pneumonia. None of the five trials with all-cause mortality data were powered to investigate this outcome. Only two trials have data on all-cause admissions.The main analysis for this review involved HIV-1 negative children and used the pooled results of random-effects model, intent-to-treat analysis (ITT).Pooled vaccine efficacy (VE) for VT-IPD was 80\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 58\% to 90\%, P {$<$} 0.0001); all serotypes-IPD, 58\% (95\% CI 29\% to 75\%, P = 0.001); World Health Organization X-ray defined pneumonia was 27\% (95\% CI 15\% to 36\%, P {$<$} 0.0001); clinical pneumonia, 6\% (95\% CI 2\% to 9\%, P = 0.0006); and all-cause mortality, 11\% (95\% CI -1\% to 21\%, P = 0.08). Analysis involving HIV-1 positive children had similar findings.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: PCV is effective in preventing IPD, X-ray defined pneumonia, and clinical pneumonia among HIV-1 negative and HIV-1 positive children under two years. The impact was greater for VT-IPD than for all serotypes-IPD, and for X-ray defined pneumonia than for clinical pneumonia. An 11\% reduction with a 95\% CI of -1\% to 21\% and a P = 0.08 is compatible with reduction in all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Introduction Estimating the contribution of influenza to excess mortality in the population presents substantial methodological challenges. Aim In a modelling study we combined environmental, epidemiological and laboratory surveillance data to estimate influenza-attributable mortality in Greece, over four seasons (2013/14 to 2016/17), specifically addressing the lag dimension and the confounding effect of temperature. Methods Associations of influenza type/subtype-specific incidence proxies and of daily mean temperature with mortality were estimated with a distributed-lag nonlinear model with 30 days of maximum lag, separately by age group (all ages, 15–64 and ≥ 65 years old). Total and weekly deaths attributable to influenza and cold temperatures were calculated. Results Overall influenza-attributable mortality was 23.6 deaths per 100,000 population per year (95\% confidence interval (CI): 17.8 to 29.2), and varied greatly between seasons, by influenza type/subtype and by age group, with the vast majority occurring in persons aged ≥ 65 years. Most deaths were attributable to A(H3N2), followed by influenza B. During periods of A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation, weekly attributable mortality to this subtype among people ≥ 65 years old increased rapidly at first, but then fell to zero and even negative, suggesting a mortality displacement (harvesting) effect. Mortality attributable to cold temperatures was much higher than that attributable to influenza. Conclusions Studies of influenza-attributable mortality need to consider distributed-lag effects, stratify by age group and adjust both for circulating influenza virus types/subtypes and daily mean temperatures, in order to produce reliable estimates. Our approach addresses these issues, is readily applicable in the context of influenza surveillance, and can be useful for other countries.},

  abstract = {Heatwaves can lead to a range of adverse impacts including increased risk of illness and mortality; the heatwave in August 2003 has been associated with \textasciitilde{}70,000 deaths across Europe. Due to climate change, heatwaves are likely to become more intense, more frequent and last longer in the future. A number of factors may influence risks associated with heat exposure, such as population age, housing type, and location within the Urban Heat Island, and such factors may not be evenly distributed spatially across a region. We simulated and analysed two major heatwaves in the UK, in August 2003 and July 2006, to assess spatial vulnerability to heat exposure across the West Midlands, an area containing \textasciitilde{}5 million people, and how ambient temperature varies in relation to factors that influence heat-related health effects, through weighting of ambient temperatures according to distributions of these factors across an urban area. Additionally we present quantification of how particular centres such as hospitals are exposed to the UHI, by comparing temperatures at these locations with average temperatures across the region, and presenting these results for both day and night times. We find that UHI intensity was substantial during both heatwaves, reaching a maximum of +9.6°C in Birmingham in July 2006. Previous work has shown some housing types, such as flats and terraced houses, are associated with increased risk of overheating, and our results show that these housing types are generally located within the warmest parts of the city. Older age groups are more susceptible to the effects of heat. Our analysis of distribution of population based on age group showed there is only small spatial variation in ambient temperature that different age groups are exposed to. Analysis of relative deprivation across the region indicates more deprived populations are located in the warmest parts of the city.},

  abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children persists as a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, despite the introduction of antimicrobial therapy. Following colonization, invasive disease may result from dissemination from a respiratory focus, such as in the case of acute otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia, or from dissemination from an unidentified focus to the central nervous system, pleural space, periorbital tissue, bone, or joint. The major clinical syndromes are reflective of the pathogenesis as either (i) bacteremia with or without focal complications or (ii) contiguous spread from the nasopharynx to mucosal surfaces of the lung and middle ear, resulting in pneumonia and acute otitis media, respectively. A temperature greater than 39ºC at follow-up is the best correlate of whether a given child is likely to have persistent bacteremia or a new focus of infection. Complications such as meningitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, or periorbital cellulitis are most common. The role of Streptococcus pneumoniae compared to that of other bacterial pathogens, especially Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, has been reported in numerous cross-sectional studies globally. Friedland and Klugman observed that 80\% of children with penicillin-nonsusceptible strains causing pneumococcal meningitis had an unsatisfactory outcome when treated with chloramphenicol compared to 33\% of children with penicillin-susceptible types of pneumococcal disease. Preventative measures such as vaccination will contribute substantially toward attaining the United Nations millennium goal of reducing childhood mortality by two-thirds in 2015 compared to 1990 levels.},

The first involves the resampling of observations and the second involves the resampling of Pearson residuals taking into account changes in the distribution of residuals associated with the expected values of counts. The use of both methods is illustrated on two data sets; one data set concerns the number of ear infections of swimmers related to whether they are frequent swimmers or not and three other variables, and the other data set concerns the number of visits to a doctor made in the last 2 weeks related to the age of subjects and 10 other variables. A third data set on the number of marine mammal interactions in different years and fishing areas is also used as an example. In this case only the second bootstrap method can be used because the nature of the data allows the bootstrap resampling of observations to produce sets of data that could not have occurred in practice. Simulation results indicate that the bootstrap results are slightly better than the results from a conventional analysis for the first data set, and much better than the results from a conventional analysis for the second data set, but a conventional analysis works well for the third data set while there are problems with bootstrap analyses.},

Determination of circulating S. pneumoniae serotypes is an essential service by public health laboratories for the monitoring of putative serotype replacement following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) and of the efficacy of the immunization program. The Quellung method remains the gold standard for typing S. pneumoniae. Although this method is very effective, it is also costly, time consuming and not totally reliable due to its subjective nature. The objectives of this study were to test and evaluate the efficiency of 3 different molecular methods compared to the Quellung method. Sequential multiplex PCR, sequetyping and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were chosen and tested using a set of diverse S. pneumoniae. One-hundred and eighteen isolates covering 83 serotypes were subjected to multiplex PCR and sequetyping while 88 isolates covering 53 serotypes were subjected to WGS. Sequential multiplex PCR allowed the identification of a significant proportion (49\%) of serotypes at the serogroup or subset level but only 27\% were identified at the serotype level. Using WGS, 55\% to 60\% of isolates were identified at the serotype level depending on the analysis strategy used. Finally, sequetyping demonstrated the lowest performance, with 17\% of misidentified serotypes. The use of Jin cpsB database instead of the GenBank database slightly improved results but did not significantly impact the efficiency of sequetyping. Although none of these molecular methods may currently replace the Quellung method, WGS remains the most promising molecular pneumococcal serotyping method.},

We analyze changes in summer temperatures, the frequency, severity, and duration of heat waves, and heat-related mortality in India between 1960 and 2009 using data from the India Meteorological Department. Mean temperatures across India have risen by more than 0.5°C over this period, with statistically significant increases in heat waves. Using a novel probabilistic model, we further show that the increase in summer mean temperatures in India over this period corresponds to a 146\% increase in the probability of heat-related mortality events of more than 100 people. In turn, our results suggest that future climate warming will lead to substantial increases in heat-related mortality, particularly in developing low-latitude countries, such as India, where heat waves will become more frequent and populations are especially vulnerable to these extreme temperatures. Our findings indicate that even moderate increases in mean temperatures may cause great increases in heat-related mortality and support the efforts of governments and international organizations to build up the resilience of these vulnerable regions to more severe heat waves.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study describes heat- and cold-related mortality in 12 urban populations in low- and middle-income countries, thereby extending knowledge of how diverse populations, in non-OECD countries, respond to temperature extremes.
METHODS: The cities were: Delhi, Monterrey, Mexico City, Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Salvador, São Paulo, Santiago, Cape Town, Ljubljana, Bucharest and Sofia. For each city, daily mortality was examined in relation to ambient temperature using autoregressive Poisson models (2- to 5-year series) adjusted for season, relative humidity, air pollution, day of week and public holidays.
RESULTS: Most cities showed a U-shaped temperature-mortality relationship, with clear evidence of increasing death rates at colder temperatures in all cities except Ljubljana, Salvador and Delhi and with increasing heat in all cities except Chiang Mai and Cape Town. Estimates of the temperature threshold below which cold-related mortality began to increase ranged from 15 degrees C to 29 degrees C; the threshold for heat-related deaths ranged from 16 degrees C to 31 degrees C. Heat thresholds were generally higher in cities with warmer climates, while cold thresholds were unrelated to climate.
CONCLUSIONS: Urban populations, in diverse geographic settings, experience increases in mortality due to both high and low temperatures. The effects of heat and cold vary depending on climate and non-climate factors such as the population disease profile and age structure. Although such populations will undergo some adaptation to increasing temperatures, many are likely to have substantial vulnerability to climate change. Additional research is needed to elucidate vulnerability within populations.},

  abstract = {The first cases of the current West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (hereafter referred to as Ebola) were reported on March 22, 2014, with a report of 49 cases in Guinea. By August 31, 2014, a total of 3,685 probable, confirmed, and suspected cases in West Africa had been reported. To aid in planning for additional disease-control efforts, CDC constructed a modeling tool called EbolaResponse to provide estimates of the potential number of future cases. If trends continue without scale-up of effective interventions, by September 30, 2014, Sierra Leone and Liberia will have a total of approximately 8,000 Ebola cases. A potential underreporting correction factor of 2.5 also was calculated. Using this correction factor, the model estimates that approximately 21,000 total cases will have occurred in Liberia and Sierra Leone by September 30, 2014. Reported cases in Liberia are doubling every 15-20 days, and those in Sierra Leone are doubling every 30-40 days. The EbolaResponse modeling tool also was used to estimate how control and prevention interventions can slow and eventually stop the epidemic. In a hypothetical scenario, the epidemic begins to decrease and eventually end if approximately 70\% of persons with Ebola are in medical care facilities or Ebola treatment units (ETUs) or, when these settings are at capacity, in a non-ETU setting such that there is a reduced risk for disease transmission (including safe burial when needed). In another hypothetical scenario, every 30-day delay in increasing the percentage of patients in ETUs to 70\% was associated with an approximate tripling in the number of daily cases that occur at the peak of the epidemic (however, the epidemic still eventually ends). Officials have developed a plan to rapidly increase ETU capacities and also are developing innovative methods that can be quickly scaled up to isolate patients in non-ETU settings in a way that can help disrupt Ebola transmission in communities. The U.S. government and international organizations recently announced commitments to support these measures. As these measures are rapidly implemented and sustained, the higher projections presented in this report become very unlikely.},

Mathematical modelling plays an increasingly important role in helping to guide the most high impact and cost-effective means of achieving these goals. Public health programmes are usually implemented over a long period of time with broad benefits to many in the community. Clinical trials are seldom large enough to capture these effects. Observational data may be used to evaluate a programme after it is underway, but have limited value in helping to predict the future impact of a proposed policy. Furthermore, public health practitioners are often required to respond to new threats, for which there is little or no previous data on which to assess the threat. Computational and mathematical models can help to assess potential threats and impacts early in the process, and later aid in interpreting data from complex and multifactorial systems. As such, these models can be critical tools in guiding public health action. However, there are a number of challenges in achieving a successful interface between modelling and public health. Here, we discuss some of these challenges.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pneumococcal pneumonia (PP) has a high burden of morbimortality in children. Use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) is an effective preventive measure. After PCV 7-valent (PCV7) withdrawal, PCV 10-valent (PCV10) and PCV 13-valent (PCV13) are the alternatives in Peru. This study aimed to evaluate cost effectiveness of these vaccines in preventing PP in Peruvian children {$<$}5 years-old.
METHODOLOGY: A cost-effectiveness analysis was developed in three phases: a systematic evidence search for calculating effectiveness; a cost analysis for vaccine strategies and outcome management; and an economic model based on decision tree analysis, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using acceptability curves, tornado diagram, and Monte Carlo simulation. A hypothetic 100 vaccinated children/vaccine cohort was built. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.
RESULTS: The isolation probability for all serotypes in each vaccine was estimated: 38\% for PCV7, 41\% PCV10, and 17\% PCV13. Avoided hospitalization was found to be the best effectiveness model measure. Estimated costs for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 cohorts were USD13,761, 11,895, and 12,499, respectively. Costs per avoided hospitalization were USD718 for PCV7, USD333 for PCV10, and USD 162 for PCV13. At ICER, PCV7 was dominated by the other PCVs. Eliminating PCV7, PCV13 was more cost effective than PCV10 (confirmed in sensitivity analysis).
CONCLUSIONS: PCV10 and PCV13 are more cost effective than PCV7 in prevention of pneumonia in children {$<$}5 years-old in Peru. PCV13 prevents more hospitalizations and is more cost-effective than PCV10. These results should be considered when making decisions about the Peruvian National Inmunizations Schedule.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has reduced vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease but increases in non-vaccine-type (NVT) disease have varied between countries. We assess the effect of the PCV7 vaccination on VT and NVT disease in England and Wales.
Methods
The study cohort was the population of England and Wales from July, 2000, to June, 2010. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to compare incidences of VT and NVT disease before (2000–06) and after (2009–10) the introduction of PCV7. We used data from the national surveillance database. Cases included in our analysis were restricted to those confirmed by culture linked with isolates referred for serotyping at the national reference centre by laboratories in England and Wales. We adjusted for potential bias from missing data (serotype and age of patient) and changes in case ascertainment rates during the study period.
Findings
5809 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were reported in 2009–10, giving an incidence of 10·6 per 100\hphantom{,}000 population in 2009–10, which, when compared with the adjusted average annual incidence of 16·1 in 2000–06, gives an overall reduction of 34\% (95\% CI 28–39). VT disease decreased in all age groups, with reductions of 98\% in individuals younger than 2 years and 81\% in those aged 65 years or older. NVT disease increased by 68\% in individuals younger than 2 years and 48\% in those aged 65 years or older, giving an overall reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease of 56\% in those younger than 2 years and 19\% in those aged 65 years or older. After vaccine introduction, more NVT serotypes increased in frequency than decreased, which is consistent with vaccine-induced replacement. Key serotypes showing replacement were 7F, 19A, and 22F. Increases in NVT invasive pneumococcal disease were not associated with antimicrobial resistance.
Interpretation
Despite much serotype replacement, a substantial reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease in young children can be achieved with PCV7 vaccination, with some indirect benefit in older age groups. Further reductions should be achievable by use of higher valency vaccines. Robust surveillance data are needed to properly assess the epidemiological effect of multivalent pneumococcal disease vaccines.

VE for 7F and 19A was 76\% (21-93\%) and 70\% (10-90\%) respectively for ≥one dose. VE for serotypes 1 and 3 was 62\% and 66\% respectively although confidence intervals spanned zero.

  abstract = {For count responses, the situation of excess zeros (relative to what standard models allow) often occurs in biomedical and sociological applications. Modeling repeated measures of zero-inflated count data presents special challenges. This is because in addition to the problem of extra zeros, the correlation between measurements upon the same subject at different occasions needs to be taken into account. This article discusses random effect models for repeated measurements on this type of response variable. A useful model is the hurdle model with random effects, which separately handles the zero observations and the positive counts. In maximum likelihood model fitting, we consider both a normal distribution and a nonparametric approach for the random effects. A special case of the hurdle model can be used to test for zero inflation. Random effects can also be introduced in a zero-inflated Poisson or negative binomial model, but such a model may encounter fitting problems if there is zero deflation at any settings of the explanatory variables. A simple alternative approach adapts the cumulative logit model with random effects, which has a single set of parameters for describing effects. We illustrate the proposed methods with examples.},

The high circulation rate of Bordetella pertussis poses a threat to infants that have not been (completely) vaccinated and for whom pertussis is a severe, life-threatening, disease. The increase in pertussis is mainly found in age groups in which immunity has waned and this has resulted in the perception that waning immunity is the main or exclusive cause for the resurgence of pertussis. However, significant changes in B. pertussis populations have been observed after the introduction of vaccinations, suggesting a role for pathogen adaptation in the persistence and resurgence of pertussis. These changes include antigenic divergence with vaccine strains and increased production of pertussis toxin. Antigenic divergence will affect both memory recall and the efficacy of antibodies, while higher levels of pertussis toxin may increase suppression of the innate and acquired immune system. We propose these adaptations of B. pertussis have decreased the period in which pertussis vaccines are effective and thus enhanced the waning of immunity. We plead for a more integrated approach to the pertussis problem which includes the characteristics of the vaccines, the B. pertussis populations and the interaction between the two.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2000, seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the USA and resulted in dramatic reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and moderate increases in non-PCV7 type IPD. In 2010, PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the US immunisation schedule. We aimed to assess the effect of use of PCV13 in children on IPD in children and adults in the USA.
METHODS: We used laboratory-based and population-based data on incidence of IPD from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program) in a time-series model to compare rates of IPD before and after the introduction of PCV13. Cases of IPD between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2013, were classified as being caused by the PCV13 serotypes against which PCV7 has no effect (PCV13 minus PCV7). In a time-series model, we used an expected outcomes approach to compare the reported incidence of IPD to that which would have been expected if PCV13 had not replaced PCV7.
FINDINGS: Compared with incidence expected among children younger than 5 years if PCV7 alone had been continued, incidence of IPD overall declined by 64\% (95\% interval estimate [95\% IE] 59-68) and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 serotypes declined by 93\% (91-94), by July, 2012, to June, 2013. Among adults, incidence of IPD overall also declined by 12-32\% and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 type IPD declined by 58-72\%, depending on age. We estimated that over 30\hphantom{,}000 cases of IPD and 3000 deaths were averted in the first 3 years after the introduction of PCV13.
INTERPRETATION: PCV13 reduced IPD across all age groups when used routinely in children in the USA. These findings provide reassurance that, similar to PCV7, PCVs with additional serotypes can also prevent transmission to unvaccinated populations.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed and recommended in the USA for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. Licensure was based on immunogenicity data comparing PCV13 with the earlier seven-valent formulation. Because clinical endpoints were not assessed for the new antigens, we did a postlicensure matched case-control study to assess vaccine effectiveness.
METHODS: Cases in children aged 2-59 months were identified through active surveillance in 13 sites. Controls were identified via birth registries and matched to cases by age and postal (zip) code. The primary objective was the vaccine effectiveness of at least one dose against the 13 serotypes included in PCV13. Secondary objectives included vaccine effectiveness against all-cause invasive pneumococcal disease, against antibiotic non-susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease, and among children with and without underlying conditions. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1\hphantom{,}-\hphantom{,}matched odds ratio)\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}100\%.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 722 children with invasive pneumococcal disease and 2991 controls; PCV13 serotype cases (217 [30\%]) included most commonly serotypes 19A (128 [18\%]), 7F (32 [4\%]), and 3 (43 [6\%]). Vaccine effectiveness against PCV13 serotypes was 86·0\% (95\% CI 75·5 to 92·3), driven by serotypes 19A and 7F, for which vaccine effectiveness was 85·6\% (95\% CI 70·6 to 93·5) and 96·5\% (82·7 to 100), respectively. We also identified statistically significant effectiveness against serotype 3 (79·5\%, 95\% CI 30·3 to 94·8) and against antibiotic non-susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease (65·6\%, 44·9 to 78·7). Vaccine effectiveness against all-cause invasive pneumococcal disease was 60·2\% (95\% CI 46·8 to 70·3). Vaccine effectiveness was similar among children with (81·4\%, 95\% CI 45·4 to 93·6) and without (85·8\%, 74·9 to 91·9) underlying conditions.
INTERPRETATION: PCV13 appears highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease among children in the USA in the context of routine and catch-up schedules, although some new vaccine antigens could not be assessed. PCV13 immunisation provides a robust strategy for combating pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance.

We reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2014, and found 783 cases of excess human mortality associated with heat from 164 cities in 36 countries. Based on the climatic conditions of those lethal heat events, we identified a global threshold beyond which daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity become deadly. Around 30\% of the world’s population is currently exposed to climatic conditions exceeding this deadly threshold for at least 20 days a year. By 2100, this percentage is projected to increase to \textasciitilde{}48\% under a scenario with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and \textasciitilde{}74\% under a scenario of growing emissions. An increasing threat to human life from excess heat now seems almost inevitable, but will be greatly aggravated if greenhouse gases are not considerably reduced.},

Only a few of the currently available methods deal explicitly with estimation of the number and location of change points, and moreover these methods may be somewhat vulnerable to deviations of model assumptions usually employed.
RESULTS: We present a computationally efficient method to obtain estimates of the number and location of the change points. The method is based on a simple transformation of data and it provides results quite robust to model misspecifications. The efficiency of the method guarantees moderate computational times regardless of the series length and the number of change points.

We present score-type confidence intervals derived from the score statistic itself and from the recently proposed gradient statistic. Due to lack of regularity conditions of the score, non-smoothness and non-monotonicity, naive application of the score-based statistics is unfeasible and we propose to exploit the smoothed score obtained via induced smoothing. We compare our proposals with the traditional methods based on the Wald and the likelihood ratio statistics via simulations and an analysis of a real dataset: results show that the smoothed score-like statistics perform in practice somewhat better than competitors, even when the model is not correctly specified.},

These alternatives permit more flexible specification of the data-generating process (dgp) than do familiar count data models (e.g., the Poisson), and provide a natural means for modeling data that are over- or underdispersed by the standards of the basic models. In the cases considered, the familiar forms of the distributions result as parameter-restricted versions of the proposed modified distributions. Accordingly, score tests of the restrictions that use only the easily-computed ML estimates of the standard models are proposed. The tests proposed by Hausman (1978) and White (1982) are also considered. The tests are then applied to count data models estimated using survey microdata on beverage consumption.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strong heat load has negative impacts on the human health and results in higher mortality during heat waves. In Europe, the summer 2003 was responsible for a high number of heat-related deaths, especially in Western Europe. Vienna was only partially affected. The aim of this study is to compare the heat-related mortality of 2003 with other years and to analyze whether 2003 was exceptional in Vienna. METHODS: The analysis is based on both meteorological and mortality data for the federal state of Vienna (Austria) for 1970–2007. We used the human-biometeorological index Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) in order to assess the heat load affecting the human body, and considered short-term adaptation by the HeRATE approach. Each day between April and October was classified according to its thermal stress level and the mean mortality for each class was analyzed. Two approaches, with and without long-term sensitivity trends were considered. RESULTS: Mortality increases significantly with thermal stress, but this increase attenuated in the last decades. Based on the sensitivity for the period of investigation, 2003 was the year with the highest heat-related mortality. Including the long-term sensitivity trend, other years (1992, 1994 and 2000) were characterised by higher values. DISCUSSION: In the last decades the number of days with heat stress increased, but the sensitivity to heat stress decreased. This could indicate long-term adaptation processes. Hence, heat-related mortality in 2003 was high, but not exceptionally high.},

  abstract = {IntroductionStreptococcus pneumoniae can cause invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), such as bacteremic pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and sepsis, and non-IPDs, such as otitis media, nonbacteremic pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections. It was estimated in 2000 that, worldwide, S. pneumoniae was responsible for 826,000 deaths annually in children aged between 1 month and 5 years. A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was licensed in 2000 in the USA and in 2001 in Europe.MethodsA literature search was performed in PubMed to identify studies assessing the impact of routine childhood PCV7 vaccination on pneumococcal morbidity and mortality. Here, the impact on IPD is reported.ResultsA total of 37 articles reporting impact data on IPD were included in this review: four from Australia, 17 from western Europe, and 16 from North America. In vaccine-eligible children in the postvaccination period, a reduction ranging from 39.9\% in Spain to 99.1\% in the USA in vaccine-type (VT) IPD incidence, compared with the prevaccination period, was reported in 18 studies. All but one of the 30 studies assessing the impact of PCV7 on all-type IPD reported a reduction ranging from 1.7\% in Spain to 76.3\% in Australia. In addition, the majority of studies reported reductions in VT and all-type IPD incidence in age groups that were not vaccine eligible.ConclusionsThe results from this review illustrate that PCV7 has had a significant impact on IPD across all ages through its use in pediatric immunization programs. With the introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) further reductions in the incidence of IPD due to the six additional serotypes included, as well as continued protection against IPD due to PCV7 serotypes may be expected. Robust surveillance systems are essential for the evaluation of the impact of PCV13 on all-type IPD and for monitoring the evolution of non-VT IPD.},

The 10-valent PCV (PCV10) was officially introduced throughout Ugandan national childhood immunization programs in 2013 and rolled-out countrywide during 2014. We aimed to measure the age-specific Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage and serotype distribution across all population age groups in the pre-PCV10 era in South Western Uganda.
METHODS: We conducted a two-stage cluster, age-stratified, cross-sectional community-based study in Sheema North sub-district between January and March 2014. One NP swab was collected and analyzed for each participant in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines.
RESULTS: NP carriage of any pneumococcal serotype was higher among children {$<$}2years old (77\%; n=387) than among participants aged ≥15years (8.5\%; n=325) (chi2 p{$<$}0.001). Of the 623 positive cultures, we identified 49 serotypes among 610 (97.9\%) isolates; thirteen (2.1\%) isolates were non-typeable. Among {$<$}2years old, serotypes 6A, 6B, 14, 15B, 19F and 23F accounted for half of all carriers. Carriage prevalence with PCV10 serotypes was 29.4\% among individuals aged {$<$}2years (n=387), 23.4\% in children aged 2-4years (n=217), 11.4\% in 5-14years (n=417), and 0.4\% among individuals ≥15years of age (n=325). The proportion of carried pneumococci serotypes contained in PCV10 was 38.1\% (n=291), 32.8\% (n=154), 29.4\% (n=156), and 4.4\% (n=22) among carriers aged {$<$}2years, 2-4years, 5-14years and ≥15years, respectively.
DISCUSSION: In Sheema district, the proportion of PCV10 serotypes was low ({$<$}40\%), across all age groups, especially among individuals aged 15years or older ({$<$}5\%). PCV10 introduction is likely to impact transmission among children and to older individuals, but less likely to substantially modify pneumococcal NP ecology among individuals aged 15years or older.},

The density of carrier population is assumed to be governed by a generalized logistic model and is dependent on environmental and human factors which are conducive to the growth of carrier population. The model is analyzed using stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulation. We have found a threshold condition, in terms of vaccine induced reproduction number R(�) which is, if less than one, the disease dies out in the absence of carriers provided the vaccine efficacy is high enough, and otherwise the infection is maintained in the population. The model also exhibits backward bifurcation at R(�) = 1. It is also shown that the spread of an infectious disease increases as the carrier population density increases. In addition, the constant immigration of susceptibles makes the disease more endemic.},

We compared the vaccines (prevaccination 2007-2009 vs postvaccination 2013-2016) in Sweden, where the 21 counties use either PCV10 or PCV13 (introduced 2009-2010).
Methods: All IPD episodes (n = 16992) were recorded in Sweden during 2005-2016. Of 14\hspace{0.25em}186 isolates from 2007-2016, 13\hspace{0.25em}468 (94.9\%) were characterized with serotyping and 12\hspace{0.25em}235 (86.2\%) with antibiotic susceptibility. Poisson models assessed changes in incidence over time.
Results: Invasive pneumococcal disease incidences decreased between 2005 and 2016 in vaccinated children (by 68.5\%), and in the whole population (by 13.5\%), but not among the elderly (increased by 2\%) due to a substantial increase in nonvaccine types (NVTs). In 2016, NVTs constituted 72\% of IPD cases in the elderly. Serotype 6A declined in PCV10 and PCV13 counties, whereas serotype 19A increased in PCV10 counties. There was no effect against serotype 3. Cross-protection was found between 6B and 6A but not between 19F and 19A. Serotype 6C increased in PCV10 counties, but not in PCV13 counties, suggesting cross-protection with 6A, which is included in PCV13. In the elderly, the increase in NVTs, excluding 6C, was more pronounced in PCV13 counties.
Conclusions: The overall impact of IPD incidences was not statistically different irrespective of vaccine used. The incidence of serotypes, where the effect of the vaccines differed, will influence the cost-effectiveness of which vaccine to use in immunization programs. The dominance of NVTs suggests a limited effect of current pediatric PCVs against IPD in the elderly.},

Diagnoses of patients who had been transported to hospitals in Linz were also available on a daily basis from eight years for time series analyses of cardiopulmonary emergencies. Increases in air pollutant levels over several days were followed by increases in mortality and the observed effects increased with the length of the exposure window considered, up to a maximum of 15 days. These mortality changes in Graz and Linz showed similar patterns like the ones found before in Vienna. A significant association of mortality could be demonstrated with NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 even in summer, when concentrations are lower and mainly related to motor traffic. Cardiorespiratory ambulance transports increased with NO2/PM2.5/PM10 by 2.0/6.1/1.7\% per 10 µg/m3 on the same day. Monitoring of NO2 (related to motor traffic) and fine particulates at urban background stations predicts acute effects on cardiopulmonary emergencies and extended effects on cardiopulmonary mortality. Both components of urban air pollution are indicators of acute cardiopulmonary health risks, which need to be monitored and reduced, even below current standards.},

  abstract = {Several European countries have timely all-cause mortality monitoring. However, small changes in mortality may not give rise to signals at the national level. Pooling data across countries may overcome this, particularly if changes in mortality occur simultaneously. Additionally, pooling may increase the power of monitoring populations with small numbers of expected deaths, e.g. younger age groups or fertile women. Finally, pooled analyses may reveal patterns of diseases across Europe. We describe a pooled analysis of all-cause mortality across 16 European countries. Two approaches were explored. In the ‘summarized’ approach, data across countries were summarized and analysed as one overall country. In the ‘stratified’ approach, heterogeneities between countries were taken into account. Pooling using the ‘stratified’ approach was the most appropriate as it reflects variations in mortality. Excess mortality was observed in all winter seasons albeit slightly higher in 2008/09 than 2009/10 and 2010/11. In the 2008/09 season, excess mortality was mainly in elderly adults. In 2009/10, when pandemic influenza A(H1N1) dominated, excess mortality was mainly in children. The 2010/11 season reflected a similar pattern, although increased mortality in children came later. These patterns were less clear in analyses based on data from individual countries. We have demonstrated that with stratified pooling we can combine local mortality monitoring systems and enhance monitoring of mortality across Europe.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In temperate zones, all-cause mortality exhibits a marked seasonality, and influenza represents a major cause of winter excess mortality. We present a statistical model, FluMOMO, which estimate influenza-associated mortality from all-cause mortality data and apply it to Danish data from 2010/11 to 2016/17.
METHODS: We applied a multivariable time series model with all-cause mortality as outcome, influenza activity and extreme temperatures as explanatory variables while adjusting for time trend and seasonality. Three indicators of weekly influenza activity (IA) were explored: percentage of consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) at primary health care, national percentage of influenza-positive samples, and the product of ILI percentage and percentage of influenza-positive specimens in a given week, that is, the Goldstein index.
RESULTS: Independent of the choice of parameter to represent influenza activity, the estimated influenza-associated mortality showed similar patterns with the Goldstein index being the most conservative. Over the 7 winter seasons, the median influenza-associated mortality per 100~000 population was 17.6 (range: 0.0-36.8), 14.1 (0.3-31.6) and 8.3 (0.0-25.0) for the 3 indicators, respectively, for all ages.
CONCLUSION: The FluMOMO model fitted the Danish data well and has the potential to estimate all-cause influenza-associated mortality in near real time and could be used as a standardised method in other countries. We recommend using the Goldstein index as the influenza activity indicator in the FluMOMO model. Further work is needed to improve the interpretation of the estimated effects.},

  abstract = {Objectives
Weekly monitoring of European all-cause excess mortality, the EuroMOMO network, observed high excess mortality during the influenza B/Yamagata dominated 2017/18 winter season, especially among elderly. We describe all-cause excess and influenza-attributable mortality during the season 2017/18 in Europe.
Methods
Based on weekly reporting of mortality from 24 European countries or sub-national regions, representing 60\% of the European population excluding the Russian and Turkish parts of Europe, we estimated age stratified all-cause excess morality using the EuroMOMO model. In addition, age stratified all-cause influenza-attributable mortality was estimated using the FluMOMO algorithm, incorporating influenza activity based on clinical and virological surveillance data, and adjusting for extreme temperatures.
Results
Excess mortality was mainly attributable to influenza activity from December 2017 to April 2018, but also due to exceptionally low temperatures in February-March 2018. The pattern and extent of mortality excess was similar to the previous A(H3N2) dominated seasons, 2014/15 and 2016/17. The 2017/18 overall all-cause influenza-attributable mortality was estimated to be 25.4 (95\%CI 25.0-25.8) per 100,000 population; 118.2 (116.4-119.9) for persons aged 65. Extending to the European population this translates into over-all 152,000 deaths.
Conclusions
The high mortality among elderly was unexpected in an influenza B dominated season, which commonly are considered to cause mild illness, mainly among children. Even though A(H3N2) also circulated in the 2017/18 season and may have contributed to the excess mortality among the elderly, the common perception of influenza B only having a modest impact on excess mortality in the older population may need to be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95\% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This system is based on meteorological data and gives three days advanced heat wave predictions. This 2003 summer had several unusual heat periods that were extremely well predicted.This article aims at presenting the Heat Health Warning System, detailing its background, methods and its five years experience. Beyond that a particular review of the summer of 2003 is done.The 2003 summer July–August 17 day heat wave seems to have generated about 2200 excess deaths. When age, sex and district population adjustments are made the excess mortality is evaluated at 1953 heat related deceased.Heat related mortality affected mainly elder and female individuals.The surveillance partners had difficulties in conveying out messages to the population, using the media, late in the heat stress period.Our 2003 summer experience lead to the conclusion that active ways must be sought to convey information to the population, when such a silent disaster is predicted. Passive systems, such as using the media to spread messages of interest during heat stress periods, are not reliable especially in a very long heat wave.},

  abstract = {In Portugal a Heat Health Watch Warning exists since 1999—the íCARO Surveillance System. It is a system for monitoring heatwaves with potential impacts on population's morbidity and mortality, which is set in motion every year between May and September. This system was based on a model for the relation between heat and mortality calibrated with the district of Lisbon data for the big heatwaves of June 1981 and July 1991. The occurrence of 2003's big heatwave brought opportunity for updating existing models. The fact that this heatwave has been particularly long and had characteristics that were not described in the previously known heatwave episodes also allowed the chance to investigate the mechanism of the relation between occurrence of extreme heat and mortality. The aim of this work was to update the existing íCARO model and contribute to increase the knowledge on the phenomena of the heatwave's impact on mortality. Thus, four models were assayed, that represent four distinct proposals for reference temperature's thresholds and in the generalization of the main used variable accumulated thermal overcharge (ATO). All the assayed models showed a good adaptation to the observed mortality data for the district of Lisbon for the three known big heatwaves. It is concluded that the rational generalized accumulated thermal overload (GATO) adapts well to the relation between heat and mortality. The best model was chosen as the one that considered a dynamic threshold that follows the ascending phase of the temperatures of summer until reaching its maximum level in the end of the month of August remaining thereafter constant until the end of the summer, thus recurring to a rational of population's adaptation to heat, contrarily to what happens to air temperatures that decrease at end of the summer.

This work describes the VDM system and how it evolved to become an automated system operating year-round, and shows briefly its potential using mortality data from January 2006 to June 2009 collected by the system itself. The new system has important advantages such as: rapid information acquisition, completeness (the entire population is included), lightness (very little information is exchanged, date of death, age, sex, place of death registration). It allows rapid detection of impacts (within five days) and allows a quick preliminary quantification of impacts that usually took several years to be done. These characteristics make this system a powerful tool for public health action. The VDM system also represents an example of inter-institutional cooperation, bringing together organisations from two different ministries, Health and Justice, aiming at improving knowledge about the mortality in the population.},

This association continued when the data were corrected for sex, age, and marital state. For hypertension both men and women who snored between the fifth and 10th decades had a twofold increase over non-snorers. The prevalence of heart disease and other conditions, except for diabetes and asthma, also increased in snorers in this age group. When corrected for smoking and obesity the association between snoring, hypertension, and heart disease persisted. These findings extend those of Lugaresi et al, and if they could be confirmed snoring as a risk factor for conditions other than sleep apnoea and sleep disorders might be considered.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children worldwide. However, many countries lack national estimates of disease burden. Effective interventions are available, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and case management. To support local and global policy decisions on pneumococcal disease prevention and treatment, we estimated country-specific incidence of serious cases and deaths in children younger than 5 years.
METHODS: We measured the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia by applying the proportion of pneumonia cases caused by S pneumoniae derived from efficacy estimates from vaccine trials to WHO country-specific estimates of all-cause pneumonia cases and deaths. We also estimated burden of meningitis and non-pneumonia, non-meningitis invasive disease using disease incidence and case-fatality data from a systematic literature review. When high-quality data were available from a country, these were used for national estimates. Otherwise, estimates were based on data from neighbouring countries with similar child mortality. Estimates were adjusted for HIV prevalence and access to care and, when applicable, use of vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b.
FINDINGS: In 2000, about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease (uncertainty range 11.1-18.0 million) were estimated to occur. Pneumococcal disease caused about 826,000 deaths (582,000-926,000) in children aged 1-59 months, of which 91,000 (63,000-102,000) were in HIV-positive and 735,000 (519,000-825,000) in HIV-negative children. Of the deaths in HIV-negative children, over 61\% (449,000 [316,000-501,000]) occurred in ten African and Asian countries.
INTERPRETATION: S pneumoniae causes around 11\% (8-12\%) of all deaths in children aged 1-59 months (excluding pneumococcal deaths in HIV-positive children). Achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goal 4 for child mortality reduction can be accelerated by prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease, especially in regions of the world with the greatest burden.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of a pneumococcal vaccine containing ten serotype-specific polysaccharides conjugated to Haemophilus influenzae protein D, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria toxoid as the carrier proteins (PHiD-CV10) against invasive pneumococcal disease.
METHODS: In this cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, children aged younger than 19 months received PHiD-CV10 in 52 clusters or hepatitis vaccines as control in 26 clusters. Infants aged younger than 7 months at the first vaccination received either a 3+1 or a 2+1 vaccination schedule, children aged 7-11 months received a 2+1 schedule, and those 12-18 months of age received a two-dose schedule. The primary and secondary objectives were to assess vaccine effectiveness against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease due to any of the ten vaccine serotypes for the 3+1 and 2+1 schedules, respectively, in children who received at least one PHiD-CV10 dose before 7 months of age. Masked follow-up of pneumococcal disease lasted from the first vaccination (from February, 2009, to October, 2010) to January 31, 2012. Invasive disease data were retrieved from data accumulated in the national infectious diseases register. This trial and the nested acute otitis media trial are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00861380 and NCT00839254, respectively.
FINDINGS: 47,369 children were enrolled from February, 2009, to October, 2010. 30,528 participants were assessed for the primary objective. 13 culture-confirmed vaccine-type cases of invasive pneumococcal disease were detected: none in the PHiD-CV10 3+1 group, one in the PHiD-CV10 2+1 group, and 12 in the control groups. The estimates for vaccine effectiveness were 100\% (95\% CI 83-100) for PHiD-CV10 3+1 and 92\% (58-100) for PHiD-CV10 2+1 groups. Two cases of any culture-confirmed invasive disease irrespective of serotype were detected in combined PHiD-CV10 infant cohorts compared with 14 in the corresponding control cohorts (vaccine effectiveness 93\%, 75-99). In catch-up cohorts, seven cases of invasive disease were reported, all in the control group: two cases in the children enrolled at 7-11 months of age; and five cases in children enrolled at 12-18 months of age (vaccine effectiveness 100\%, 79-100). Non-fatal serious adverse events suspected to be vaccine-related were reported via routine post-immunisation safety surveillance in 18 children.
INTERPRETATION: This nationwide trial showed high PHiD-CV10 effectiveness against invasive pneumococcal disease when given in different schedules. For the first time, effectiveness of a 2+1 schedule in infants was confirmed in a clinical trial.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines against culture-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease has been well documented. In the Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) trial, we reported vaccine effectiveness and absolute rate reduction against laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease (confirmation by culture or antigen or DNA detection irrespective of serotype). Here, we assessed vaccine effectiveness of PHiD-CV10 against clinically suspected invasive pneumococcal disease in children by use of diagnoses coded in hospital discharge registers.
METHODS: For this phase 3/4 cluster-randomised, double-blind trial, undertaken between Feb 18, 2009, and Dec 31, 2011, in municipal health-care centres and the Tampere University Vaccine Research Centre (Finland), we randomly assigned (2:2:1:1) 78 clusters into PHiD-CV10 three plus one, PHiD-CV10 two plus one, control three plus one, control two plus one groups (26:26:13:13 clusters) to give PHiD-CV10 in either three plus one or two plus one schedule (if enrolled before 7 months of age; infant schedules), two plus one (if enrolled between 7 and 11 months; catch-up schedules), and two doses at least 6 months apart (if enrolled between 12 and 18 months; catch-up schedules). Children were eligible if they had not received and were not anticipated to receive any of the study vaccines and had no general contraindications to vaccinations. We collected all inpatient and outpatient discharge notifications from the national hospital discharge register with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 diagnoses compatible with invasive pneumococcal disease or unspecified sepsis, and verified data with patient files. We excluded invasive pneumococcal disease cases confirmed by positive culture or DNA/RNA detection from normally sterile body fluid. The primary objective was to estimate vaccine effectiveness against all register-based non-laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease or unspecified sepsis and patient-file verified non-laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease in infants younger than 7 months at enrolment. Masked follow-up lasted from the date of the first vaccination to Dec 31, 2011. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated against all episodes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00861380 and NCT00839254.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 47,366 children. On the basis of ICD-10 diagnoses, we recorded 264 episodes of register-based non-laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease or unspecified sepsis, of which 102 were patient-file verified non-laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease. The vaccine effectiveness was 50\% (95\% CI 32-63) in the 30,527 infants with three plus one and two plus one schedules combined and the absolute incidence rate reduction was 207 episodes per 100,000 person-years (95\% CI 127-286). The vaccine effectiveness against the patient-file verified non-laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease was 71\% (95\% CI 52-83) in infant three plus one and two plus one schedules combined. The absolute rate reduction was 142 episodes per 100,000 person-years (95\% CI 91-191) in infant cohorts.
INTERPRETATION: This vaccine-probe analysis is the first report showing the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on clinically suspected invasive pneumococcal disease. The absolute rate reduction was markedly higher compared with laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal disease, which implies low sensitivity of the laboratory-based case definitions and subsequently higher public health effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines against invasive pneumococcal disease than previously estimated.

  abstract = {In 2003, a Heat Health Watch Warning System was developed in France to anticipate heat waves that may result in a large excess of mortality. The system was developed on the basis of a retrospective analysis of mortality and meteorological data in fourteen pilot cities. Several meteorological indicators were tested in relation to levels of excess mortality. Computations of sensibility and specificity were used to choose the meteorological indicators and the cut-offs. An indicator that mixes minimum and maximum temperatures was chosen. The cut-offs were set in order to anticipate events resulting in an excess mortality above 100\% in the smallest cities and above 50\% in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Lille. The system was extended nationwide using the 98th percentile of the distribution of minimum and maximum temperatures. A national action plan was set up, using this watch warning system. It was activated on 1st June 2004 on a national scale. The system implies a close cooperation between the French Weather Bureau (Météo France), the National Institute of Health Surveillance (InVS) and the Ministry of Health. The system is supported by a panel of preventive actions, to prevent the sanitary impact of heat waves.},

  abstract = {In a prospective surveillance study covering all pediatric wards in Austria, 308 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) were reported in hospitalized children {$<$}5 years of age between 2002 and 2012. Incidence was 7.1 per 100,000 per year for IPD with a case fatality rate of 3 \%, and 1.9 per 100,000 per year for pneumococcal meningitis with a case fatality rate of 9 \%. At hospital discharge, 17 \% of the children were not fully recovered and suffered from problems such as hearing or motor deficits. Persistent sequelae 6 months after hospital discharge were present in 13 \% of the children, a finding that emphasizes the seriousness of IPD. From 2007 onwards, we observed a shift of pneumococcal serotypes from those covered by the heptavalent vaccine to serotypes consequently added to 10- and 13-valent vaccines, particularly regarding serotype 19A. Among antimicrobial resistances detected, macrolide resistance was predominant; however, between 2002 and 2012, we saw an overall decrease of resistance rates.
CONCLUSION: Considering this change of serotypes and the high rate of permanent sequelae after IPD, our data show the importance of pediatric pneumococcal vaccination and the relevance of continuous monitoring of circulating serotypes. By the end of 2012, which was the first year of universal mass vaccination against pneumococcal disease in Austria, no change in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease was observed yet.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Pneumococcal conjugate bacterial vaccines that are able to prevent invasive disease and mucosal infections have been developed.
OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of published data from trials on pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was performed to determine the efficacy in reducing the incidence of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, pneumonia, and acute otitis media in healthy infants younger than 24 months.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted. Controlled clinical trials had to compare the protective efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in reducing the incidence of invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae, pneumonia, and acute otitis media in healthy infants with placebo or control vaccines. Information was extracted by using a standardized protocol.
RESULTS: The efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease was 89\% involving vaccine serotypes in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses and ranged from 63\% to 74\% for all serotypes. The efficacy to prevent acute otitis media sustained by vaccine serotypes was 55\% in the intention-to-treat and 57\% in the per-protocol analyses, whereas it was 29\% to prevent otitis involving all serotypes in the per-protocol analysis. Finally, in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, the efficacy to prevent clinical pneumonia was 6\% and 7\%, respectively, whereas for the prevention of radiograph-confirmed pneumonia it was 29\% and 32\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine produces a significant effect regarding prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. Results on prevention of otitis or pneumonia have been less striking, but considering the high burden of these diseases in infants, even a low efficacy has potential for tremendous impact on the health of infants in developing and industrialized countries.},

  abstract = {Abstract Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is arguably the strongest quasi-experimental research design. \{ITS\} is particularly useful when a randomized trial is infeasible or unethical. The approach usually involves constructing a time series of population-level rates for a particular quality improvement focus (eg, rates of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] medication initiation) and testing statistically for a change in the outcome rate in the time periods before and time periods after implementation of a policy/program designed to change the outcome. In parallel, investigators often analyze rates of negative outcomes that might be (unintentionally) affected by the policy/program. We discuss why \{ITS\} is a useful tool for quality improvement. Strengths of \{ITS\} include the ability to control for secular trends in the data (unlike a 2-period before-and-after t test), ability to evaluate outcomes using population-level data, clear graphical presentation of results, ease of conducting stratified analyses, and ability to evaluate both intended and unintended consequences of interventions. Limitations of \{ITS\} include the need for a minimum of 8 time periods before and 8 after an intervention to evaluate changes statistically, difficulty in analyzing the independent impact of separate components of a program that are implemented close together in time, and existence of a suitable control population. Investigators must also be careful not to make individual-level inferences when population-level rates are used to evaluate interventions (though \{ITS\} can be used with individual-level data). A brief description of \{ITS\} is provided, including a fully implemented (but hypothetical) study of the impact of a program to reduce \{ADHD\} medication initiation in children younger than 5 years old and insured by Medicaid in Washington State. An example of the database needed to conduct an \{ITS\} is provided, as well as \{SAS\} code to implement a difference-in-differences model using preschool-age children in California as a comparison group.},

  abstract = {The incidence of the highly infectious respiratory disease named pertussis or whooping cough has been increasing for the past two decades in different countries, as in much of the highly vaccinated world. A decrease in vaccine effectiveness over time, especially when acellular vaccines were used for primary doses and boosters, and pathogen adaptation to the immunity conferred by vaccines have been proposed as possible causes of the resurgence. The contributions of these factors are not expected to be the same in different communities, and this could lead to different epidemiological trends. In fact, differences in the magnitude and dynamics of pertussis outbreaks as well as in the distribution of notified cases by age have been reported in various regions. Using an age-structured mathematical model designed by us, we evaluated how the changes in some of the parameters that could be related to the above proposed causes of disease resurgence - vaccine effectiveness and effective transmission rates - may impact on pertussis transmission. When a linear decrease in vaccine effectiveness (VE) was assayed, a sustained increase in pertussis incidence was detected mainly in infants and children. On the other hand, when changes in effective transmission rates (βij) were made, a dynamic effect evidenced by the presence of large peaks followed by deep valleys was detected. In this case, greater incidence in adolescents than in children was observed. These different trends in the disease dynamics due to modifications in VE or βij were verified in 18 possible scenarios that represent different epidemiological situations. Interestingly we found that both incidence trends produced by the model and their age distribution resemble the profiles obtained from data reported in several regions. The implications of these correlations are discussed.},

METHODOLOGY: Infants and children (n=1150) (15\,days to 14\,years) of Greek, Roma and immigrant origin with different vaccination statuses were hospitalized in Athens, Greece with suspected pertussis infection. IS481/IS1001 real-time PCR confirmed Bordetella spp./B. pertussis infection in 300 samples. A subset of samples (n=153) were analysed by multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and (n=25) by sequence-based typing of the toxin promotor region (ptxP) on DNA extracted from clinical specimens.Results/Key findings. A complete MLVA profile was determined in 66 out of 153 samples; the B. pertussis MLVA type 27 (n=55) was the dominant genotype and all tested samples (n=25) expressed the ptxP3 genotype. The vaccine coverage in the Greek population was 90{$\mkern1mu\%$}; however, the study population expressed complete coverage in 2 out of 264 infants (0-11\,months) and in 20 out of 36 children (1-14\,years). Roma and immigrant minorities represent 7{$\mkern1mu\%$} of the Greek population, but make up 50{$\mkern1mu\%$} of the study population, indicating a low vaccine coverage among these groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The B. pertussis MT27 and ptxP3 genotype is dominant in Greek, Roma and immigrant infants and children hospitalized in Greece. Thus, the predominant MLVA genotype in Greece is similar to other countries using acellular vaccines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A key question concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is how effective and long lasting immunity against this disease is in individuals who were previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to evaluate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections in the general population in Austria.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study using national SARS-CoV-2 infection data from the Austrian epidemiological reporting system. As the primary outcome, we aim to compare the odds of SARS-CoV-2 re-infections of COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (February to April 30, 2020) versus the odds of first infections in the remainder general population by tracking polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infections of both groups during the second wave from September 1 to November 30, 2020. Re-infection counts are tentative, since it cannot be excluded that the positive PCR in the first and/or second wave might have been a false positive.
RESULTS: We recorded 40 tentative re-infections in 14~840 COVID-19 survivors of the first wave (0.27\%) and 253~581 infections in 8~885~640 individuals of the remaining general population (2.85\%) translating into an odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) of 0.09 (0.07 to 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a relatively low re-infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria. Protection against SARS-CoV-2 after natural infection is comparable with the highest available estimates on vaccine efficacies. Further well-designed research on this issue is urgently needed for improving evidence-based decisions on public health measures and vaccination strategies.},

  abstract = {The spreading of transmissible infectious diseases is inevitably entangled with the dynamics of human population. Humans are the carrier of the pathogen, and the large-scale travel and commuting patterns that govern the mobility of modern societies are defining how epidemics and pandemics travel across the world. For a long time, the development of quantitative spatially explicit models able to shed light on the global dynamics of pandemic has been limited by the lack of detailed data on human mobility. In the last 10 years, however, these limits have been lifted by the increasing availability of data generated by new information technologies, thus triggering the development of computational (microsimulation) models working at a level of single individuals in spatially extended regions of the world. Microsimulations can provide information at very detailed spatial resolutions and down to the level of single individuals. In addition, computational implementations explicitly account for stochasticity, allowing the study of multiple realizations of epidemics with the same parameters' distribution. While on the one hand these capabilities represent the richness of microsimulation methods, on the other hand they face us with a huge amount of information that requires the use of specific data reduction methods and visual analytics.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 69th World Health Assembly approved the Global Health Sector Strategy to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by 2030, which can become a reality with the recent launch of direct acting antiviral therapies. Reliable disease burden estimates are required for national strategies. This analysis estimates the global prevalence of viraemic HCV at the end of 2015, an update of-and expansion on-the 2014 analysis, which reported 80 million (95\% CI 64-103) viraemic infections in 2013.
METHODS: We developed country-level disease burden models following a systematic review of HCV prevalence (number of studies, n=6754) and genotype (n=11\hphantom{,}342) studies published after 2013. A Delphi process was used to gain country expert consensus and validate inputs. Published estimates alone were used for countries where expert panel meetings could not be scheduled. Global prevalence was estimated using regional averages for countries without data.
FINDINGS: Models were built for 100 countries, 59 of which were approved by country experts, with the remaining 41 estimated using published data alone. The remaining countries had insufficient data to create a model. The global prevalence of viraemic HCV is estimated to be 1·0\% (95\% uncertainty interval 0·8-1·1) in 2015, corresponding to 71·1 million (62·5-79·4) viraemic infections. Genotypes 1 and 3 were the most common cause of infections (44\% and 25\%, respectively).
INTERPRETATION: The global estimate of viraemic infections is lower than previous estimates, largely due to more recent (lower) prevalence estimates in Africa. Additionally, increased mortality due to liver-related causes and an ageing population may have contributed to a reduction in infections.

  abstract = {Despite continued efforts to improve health systems worldwide, emerging pathogen epidemics remain a major public health concern. Effective response to such outbreaks relies on timely intervention, ideally informed by all available sources of data. The collection, visualization and analysis of outbreak data are becoming increasingly complex, owing to the diversity in types of data, questions and available methods to address them. Recent advances have led to the rise of outbreak analytics, an emerging data science focused on the technological and methodological aspects of the outbreak data pipeline, from collection to analysis, modelling and reporting to inform outbreak response. In this article, we assess the current state of the field. After laying out the context of outbreak response, we critically review the most common analytics components, their inter-dependencies, data requirements and the type of information they can provide to inform operations in real time. We discuss some challenges and opportunities and conclude on the potential role of outbreak analytics for improving our understanding of, and response to outbreaks of emerging pathogens.This article is part of the theme issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting and control‘. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue ‘Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: approaches and important themes’.},

Here, we provide a national-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) superspreading during the first wave of infections in Austria, a country that played a major role in initial virus transmissions in Europe. Capitalizing on Austria's well-developed epidemiological surveillance system, we identified major SARS-CoV-2 clusters during the first wave of infections and performed deep whole-genome sequencing of more than 500 virus samples. Phylogenetic-epidemiological analysis enabled the reconstruction of superspreading events and charts a map of tourism-related viral spread originating from Austria in spring 2020. Moreover, we exploited epidemiologically well-defined clusters to quantify SARS-CoV-2 mutational dynamics, including the observation of low-frequency mutations that progressed to fixation within the infection chain. Time-resolved virus sequencing unveiled viral mutation dynamics within individuals with COVID-19, and epidemiologically validated infector-infectee pairs enabled us to determine an average transmission bottleneck size of 103 SARS-CoV-2 particles. In conclusion, this study illustrates the power of combining epidemiological analysis with deep viral genome sequencing to unravel the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to gain fundamental insights into mutational dynamics and transmission properties.},

Two vaccines have been developed: the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). Available data indicate that PCV13 is highly effective in reducing the risk of serotype 19A invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in both vaccinated children and unvaccinated adults. Positive data have also been published for PCV10 that suggest that the conjugated serotype 19F included in the vaccine could evoke a cross-reactive antibody response with serotype 19A. However, a great number of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases are associated with serotypes not included in either of the vaccines, and preparation of a vaccine containing all the serotypes is unrealistic. Protein vaccines are the real future to definitively reduce the pneumococcal disease burden.},

  abstract = {In the event of a new infectious disease outbreak, mathematical and simulation models are commonly used to inform policy by evaluating which control strategies will minimize the impact of the epidemic. In the early stages of such outbreaks, substantial parameter uncertainty may limit the ability of models to provide accurate predictions, and policymakers do not have the luxury of waiting for data to alleviate this state of uncertainty. For policymakers, however, it is the selection of the optimal control intervention in the face of uncertainty, rather than accuracy of model predictions, that is the measure of success that counts. We simulate the process of real-time decision-making by fitting an epidemic model to observed, spatially-explicit, infection data at weekly intervals throughout two historical outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, UK in 2001 and Miyazaki, Japan in 2010, and compare forward simulations of the impact of switching to an alternative control intervention at the time point in question. These are compared to policy recommendations generated in hindsight using data from the entire outbreak, thereby comparing the best we could have done at the time with the best we could have done in retrospect. Our results show that the control policy that would have been chosen using all the data is also identified from an early stage in an outbreak using only the available data, despite high variability in projections of epidemic size. Critically, we find that it is an improved understanding of the locations of infected farms, rather than improved estimates of transmission parameters, that drives improved prediction of the relative performance of control interventions. However, the ability to estimate undetected infectious premises is a function of uncertainty in the transmission parameters. Here, we demonstrate the need for both real-time model fitting and generating projections to evaluate alternative control interventions throughout an outbreak. Our results highlight the use of using models at outbreak onset to inform policy and the importance of state-dependent interventions that adapt in response to additional information throughout an outbreak.},

  abstract = {Designing effective public health strategies to prevent adverse health effect of hot weather is crucial in the context of global warming. In Switzerland, the 2003 heat have caused an estimated 7\% increase in all-cause mortality. As a consequence, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health developed an information campaign to raise public awareness on heat threats. For a better understanding on how hot weather affects daily mortality in Switzerland, we assessed the effect of heat on daily mortality in eight Swiss cities and population subgroups from 1995 to 2013 using different temperature metrics (daily mean (Tmean), maximum (Tmax), minimum (Tmin) and maximum apparent temperature (Tappmax)), and aimed to evaluate variations of the heat effect after 2003 (1995-2002 versus 2004-2013). We applied conditional quasi-Poisson regression models with non-linear distributed lag functions to estimate temperature-mortality associations over all cities (1995-2013) and separately for two time periods (1995-2002, 2004-2013). Relative risks (RR) of daily mortality were estimated for increases in temperature from the median to the 98th percentile of the warm season temperature distribution. Over the whole time period, significant temperature-mortality relationships were found for all temperature indicators (RR (95\% confidence interval): Tappmax: 1.12 (1.05; 1.18); Tmax: 1.15 (1.08-1.22); Tmean: 1.16 (1.09-1.23); Tmin 1.23 (1.15-1.32)). Mortality risks were higher at the beginning of the summer, especially for Tmin. In the more recent time period, we observed a non-significant reduction in the effect of high temperatures on mortality, with the age group {$>$} 74 years remaining the population at highest risk. High temperatures continue to be a considerable risk factor for human health in Switzerland after 2003. More effective public health measures targeting the elderly should be promoted with increased attention to the first heat events in summer and considering both high day-time and night-time temperatures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In an interrupted time series (ITS) design, data are collected at multiple instances over time before and after an intervention to detect whether the intervention has an effect significantly greater than the underlying secular trend. We critically reviewed the methodological quality of ITS designs using studies included in two systematic reviews (a review of mass media interventions and a review of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies).
METHODS: Quality criteria were developed, and data were abstracted from each study. If the primary study analyzed the ITS design inappropriately, we reanalyzed the results by using time series regression.
RESULTS: Twenty mass media studies and thirty-eight guideline studies were included. A total of 66\% of ITS studies did not rule out the threat that another event could have occurred at the point of intervention. Thirty-three studies were reanalyzed, of which eight had significant preintervention trends. All of the studies were considered "effective" in the original report, but approximately half of the reanalyzed studies showed no statistically significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that ITS designs are often analyzed inappropriately, underpowered, and poorly reported in implementation research. We have illustrated a framework for appraising ITS designs, and more widespread adoption of this framework would strengthen reviews that use ITS designs.},

  abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. A better understanding of HCV disease progression and the associated cost can help the medical community manage HCV and develop treatment strategies in light of the emergence of several potent anti-HCV therapies. A system dynamic model with 36 cohorts was used to provide maximum flexibility and improved forecasting. New infections incidence of 16,020 (95\% confidence interval, 13,510-19,510) was estimated in 2010. HCV viremic prevalence peaked in 1994 at 3.3 (2.8-4.0) million, but it is expected to decline by two-thirds by 2030. The prevalence of more advanced liver disease, however, is expected to increase, as well as the total cost associated with chronic HCV infection. Today, the total cost is estimated at \$6.5 (\$4.3-\$8.4) billion and it will peak in 2024 at \$9.1 (\$6.4-\$13.3) billion. The lifetime cost of an individual infected with HCV in 2011 was estimated at \$64,490. However, this cost is significantly higher among individuals with a longer life expectancy.
CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates that US HCV prevalence is in decline due to a lower incidence of infections. However, the prevalence of advanced liver disease will continue to increase as well as the corresponding healthcare costs. Lifetime healthcare costs for an HCV-infected person are significantly higher than for noninfected persons. In addition, it is possible to substantially reduce HCV infection through active management. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;57:2164-2170).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In February 2012 the ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) with a 2+1 doses schedule (3, 5, 12 or 14 months of age) without catch-up vaccination was introduced in Austria. We assessed direct and indirect vaccine effects on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) by a population-based intervention study.
METHODS: The study period was divided into pre- (2009-2011) and post-period (2013-2017, February), regarding 2012 as transition year. Outcomes were defined as PCV10 ST-IPD, the PCV10-related ST 6A and 19A IPD and non-PCV10 excluding ST 6A-/19A-IPD (NVT-IPD). We used national surveillance data and compared average monthly incidence rate (IR) between pre- and post-period among {$<$}5, 5-49 and ≥50 years old. Additionally, for the 5-49 and ≥50 years old, and the 50-59 and ≥60 years old, we analyzed monthly incidence data of the pre-, post-period, and estimated trend and level changes by using a segmented time-series regression.
RESULTS: The PCV-10 IPD was reduced by 58\% (95\% CI: 30\%; 74\%) and 67\% (95\% CI: 32\%; 84\%) among {$<$}5 and ≥50 years old; the reduction in ≥60 years was 71\% (95\% CI: 36\%; 88\%). There were no significant changes in the pre-post-rate or incidence trend of NVT-IPD in the {$<$}5 and ≥50 years old. ST-specific analyses revealed no ST 6A- and ST 19A IPD decline in any age-group, and a ST 8 IPD increase among ≥50 years old (IR ratio: 3.5; 95\% CI: 1.7; 7.2). We found no vaccine effects among 5-49 years old.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds to the evidence on direct and indirect protection of a childhood PCV10 vaccine program. Elderlies seem to benefit the most. Findings did not support PCV 10 cross-protection, but indicate replacement at least for ST 8 among the ≥50 years old. Follow-up analyses of IPD surveillance data are needed to fully characterize the magnitude of serotype replacement and further vaccine-attributable IPD reduction with time.},

  abstract = {Pertussis incidence has been rising in some countries, including the UK, despite sustained high vaccine coverage. We questioned whether it is possible to explain the resurgence without recourse to complex hypotheses about pathogen evolution, subclinical infections, or trends in surveillance efficiency. In particular, we investigated the possibility that the resurgence is a consequence of the legacy of incomplete pediatric immunization, in the context of cohort structure and age-dependent transmission. We constructed a model of pertussis transmission in England and Wales based on data on age-specific contact rates and historical vaccine coverage estimates. We evaluated the agreement between model-predicted and observed patterns of age-specific pertussis incidence under a variety of assumptions regarding the duration of immunity. Under the assumption that infection-derived immunity is complete and lifelong, and regardless of the duration of vaccine-induced immunity, the model consistently predicts a resurgence of pertussis incidence comparable to that which has been observed. Interestingly, no resurgence is predicted when infection- and vaccine-derived immunities wane at the same rate. These results were qualitatively insensitive to rates of primary vaccine failure. We conclude that the alarming resurgence of pertussis among adults and adolescents in Britain and elsewhere may simply be a legacy of historically inadequate coverage employing imperfect vaccines. Indeed, we argue that the absence of resurgence at this late date would be more surprising. Our analysis shows that careful accounting for age dependence in contact rates and susceptibility is prerequisite to the identification of which features of pertussis epidemiology want additional explanation.},

  abstract = {Sexually transmitted pathogens persist in populations despite the availability of biomedical interventions and knowledge of behavioural changes that would reduce individual-level risk. While behavioural risk factors are shared between many sexually transmitted infections, the prevalence of these diseases across different risk groups varies. Understanding this heterogeneity and identifying better control strategies depends on an improved understanding of the complex social contact networks over which pathogens spread. To date, most efforts to study the impact of sexual network structure on disease dynamics have focused on static networks. However, the interaction between the dynamics of partnership formation and dissolution and the dynamics of transmission plays a role, both in restricting the effective network accessible to the pathogen, and in modulating the transmission dynamics. We present a simple method to simulate dynamical networks of sexual partnerships. We inform the model using survey data on sexual attitudes and lifestyles, and investigate how the duration of infectiousness changes the effective contact network over which disease may spread. We then simulate several control strategies: screening, vaccination and behavioural interventions. Previous theory and research has advanced the importance of core groups for spread and control of STD. Our work is consistent with the importance of core groups, but extends this idea to consider how the duration of infectiousness associated with a particular pathogen interacts with host behaviours to define these high risk subpopulations. Characteristics of the parts of the network accessible to the pathogen, which represent the network structure of sexual contacts from the "point of view" of the pathogen, are substantially different from those of the network as a whole. The pathogen itself plays an important role in determining this effective network structure; specifically, we find that if the pathogen's duration of infectiousness is short, infection is more concentrated in high-activity, high-concurrency individuals even when all other factors are held constant. Widespread screening programmes would be enhanced by follow-up interventions targeting higher-risk individuals, because screening shortens the expected duration of infectiousness and causes a greater relative decrease in prevalence among lower-activity than in higher-activity individuals. Even for pathogens with longer durations of infectiousness, our findings suggest that targeting vaccination and behavioural interventions towards high-activity individuals provides comparable benefits to population-wide interventions.},

Long-term beneficial effects of PCVs may be countered by serotype replacement. We aimed to determine the impact of PCV-7 vaccination on pneumococcal carriage in rural Gambia.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cluster-randomized (by village) trial of the impact of PCV-7 on pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage was conducted in 21 Gambian villages between December 2003 to June 2008 (5,441 inhabitants in 2006). Analysis was complemented with data obtained before vaccination. Because efficacy of PCV-9 in young Gambian children had been shown, it was considered unethical not to give PCV-7 to young children in all of the study villages. PCV-7 was given to children below 30 mo of age and to those born during the trial in all study villages. Villages were randomized (older children and adults) to receive one dose of PCV-7 (11 vaccinated villages) or meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine (10 control villages). Cross-sectional surveys (CSSs) to collect nasopharyngeal swabs were conducted before vaccination (2,094 samples in the baseline CSS), and 4-6, 12, and 22 mo after vaccination (1,168, 1,210, and 446 samples in CSS-1, -2, and -3, respectively). A time trend analysis showed a marked fall in the prevalence of vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage in all age groups following vaccination (from 23.7\% and 26.8\% in the baseline CSS to 7.1\% and 8.5\% in CSS-1, in vaccinated and control villages, respectively). The prevalence of vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage was lower in vaccinated than in control villages among older children (5 y to {$<$}15 y of age) and adults (≥15 y of age) at CSS-2 (odds ratio [OR]{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.15 [95\% CI 0.04-0.57] and OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.32 [95\% CI 0.10-0.98], respectively) and at CSS-3 (OR{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.37 [95\% CI 0.15-0.90] for older children, and 0\% versus 7.6\% for adults in vaccinated and control villages, respectively). Differences in the prevalence of non-vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage between vaccinated and control villages were small.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of Gambian children reduced vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage across all age groups, indicating a "herd effect" in non-vaccinated older children and adults. No significant serotype replacement was detected. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.},

We analyzed pertussis notifications in US states obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System from 1951 to 2010 to explore the timing, spatial pattern and consistency of resurgence across the country. Here we show that resurgence occurred at different times in different states, spread out over a transition period of roughly three decades. Further, despite this spatial variation, broad patterns in pertussis epidemiology can be described by two dominant phases: (1) a period of decline ending in the mid-1970s, followed by (2) nationwide resurgence. Together, these patterns explain 89.7\% of the variation in US case notifications between 1951 and 2005. This resurgence was interrupted, however, by a synchronized downturn in 2005 that continues to the present in many large states. The causes of these two transitions in pertussis epidemiology remain hotly debated, though our findings suggest that evolution of the Bordetella pertussis bacterium, loss of immunity and persistent transmission among adults, and demographic drivers are more probable explanations than changes in reporting or the introduction of acellular vaccines.},

DESIGN: Analysis of variation in daily  mortality in England and Wales and in Greater London during a five day  heatwave in July and August 1995, by age, sex, and cause. SETTING: England  and Wales, and Greater London. MAIN RESULTS: An estimated 619 extra deaths  (8.9\% increase, approximate 95\% confidence interval 6.4, 11.3\%) were  observed during this heatwave in England and Wales, relative to the  expected number of deaths based on the 31-day moving average for that  period. Excess deaths were apparent in all age groups, most noticeably in  women and for deaths from respiratory and cerebrovascular disease. Using  published daily mortality risk coefficients for air pollutants in London,  it was estimated that up to 62\% of the excess mortality in England and  Wales during the heatwave may be attributable to concurrent increases in  air pollution. In Greater London itself, where daytime temperatures were  higher (and with lesser falls at night), mortality increased by 16.1\%  during the heatwave. Using the same risk coefficients to estimate the  excess mortality apparently attributable to air pollution, more than 60\% of  the total excess in London was apparently attributable to the effects of  heat. CONCLUSION: Analysis of this episode shows that exceptionally high  temperatures in England and Wales, though rare, do cause increases in daily  mortality. ,},

Count data are routinely modeled using Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB) regression but zero-inflated and hurdle models may be advantageous in this setting. Here we compared the fit of the Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), Poisson Hurdle (PH), and Negative Binomial Hurdle (NBH) models. In general, for public health studies, we may conceptualize zero-inflated models as allowing zeroes to arise from at-risk and not-at-risk populations. In contrast, hurdle models may be conceptualized as having zeroes only from an at-risk population. Our results illustrate, for our data, that the ZINB and NBH models are preferred but these models are indistinguishable with respect to fit. Choosing between the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling framework, assuming Poisson and NB models are inadequate because of excess zeroes, should generally be based on the study design and purpose. If the study's purpose is inference then modeling framework should be considered. For example, if the study design leads to count endpoints with both structural and sample zeroes then generally the zero-inflated modeling framework is more appropriate, while in contrast, if the endpoint of interest, by design, only exhibits sample zeroes (e.g., at-risk participants) then the hurdle model framework is generally preferred. Conversely, if the study's primary purpose it is to develop a prediction model then both the zero-inflated and hurdle modeling frameworks should be adequate.},

The extent of acclimatization of the population to gradually-changing thermal conditions is not well understood. We aimed to define the relationship between mortality and temperature extremes in different age groups in the Helsinki-Uusimaa hospital district in Southern Finland, and changes in sensitivity of the population to temperature extremes over the period of 1972-2014. Time series of mortality were made stationary with a method that utilizes 365-day Gaussian smoothing, removes trends and seasonality, and gives relative mortality as the result. We used generalized additive models to examine the association of relative mortality to physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and to air temperature in the 43-year study period and in two 21-year long sub-periods (1972-1992 and 1994-2014). We calculated the mean values of relative mortality in percentile-based categories of thermal indices. Relative mortality increases more in the hot than in the cold tail of the thermal distribution. The increase is strongest among those aged 75 years and older, but is somewhat elevated even among those younger than 65 years. Above the 99th percentile of the PET distribution, the all-aged relative mortality decreased in time from 18.3 to 8.6\%. Among those ≥75 years old, the decrease in relative mortality between the sub-periods were found to be above the 90th percentile. The dependence of relative mortality on cold extremes was negligible, except among those ≥75 years old, in the latter period. Thus, heat-related mortality is also remarkable in Finland, but the sensitivity to heat stress has decreased over the decades.},

This study aimed to estimate their HIV and other STI prevalence, examine their risk behaviors, and evaluate their role as a bridge population in the spread of HIV/STIs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 553 clients recruited in commercial sex sites in the province of Escuintla, Guatemala. They were interviewed and tested for HIV and other STIs. RESULTS: Half of the clients who were approached refused participation. Median age was 28.9 years; 57.7\% had a regular partner, of whom, 10.1\% had concurrent noncommercial partnerships. Consistent condom use with FSWs and regular partners was 72.5\% and 17.1\%, respectively. Approximately 18\% formed a bridge, and 40.0\% a potential bridge. Among those who provided samples (70.5\% provided a blood sample and 89.7\%, urine sample), prevalence of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes simplex virus 2 was 1.5\%, 1.0\%, 0.8\%, 5.5\%, and 3.4\%, respectively. Unprotected sex with FSWs and drug use just before sex were risk factors for having any STI (9.8\% of participants). Bridge clients were significantly less educated, more employed, paid lower prices to the FSW just visited, and had a previous STI. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relatively high prevalence of HIV in clients compared to national estimates, and a substantial proportion of them act as a bridge for HIV/STI transmission between FSWs and the general population in Escuintla. Given that this is fuelling the current HIV epidemic, preventive interventions addressing this hard-to-reach group are urgently required.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Approximately 2.7 million US individuals are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). As public health campaigns are pursued, a growing number of treatment candidates are likely to have minimal evidence of liver damage.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of newer treatments for chronic hepatitis C infection in a population of asymptomatic, HCV sero-positive but otherwise healthy individuals.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection and impact of treatment. We used an epidemiologic model to derive a range of natural history parameters that were empirically calibrated to provide a good fit to observed data on both prevalence of HCV seropositivity and time trends in outcomes related to HCV infection.
PATIENTS: Cohorts of 40-year-old men and women with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, positive results on quantitative HCV RNA assays and serologic tests for antibody to HCV, and no histological evidence of fibrosis on liver biopsy.
INTERVENTIONS: Monotherapy with standard or pegylated interferon alfa-2b; combination therapy with standard or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
RESULTS: The probability of patients with chronic HCV developing cirrhosis over a 30-year period ranged from 13\% to 46\% for men and from 1\% to 29\% for women. The incremental cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with pegylated interferon for men ranged from 26 000 dollars to 64 000 dollars per QALY for genotype 1 and from 10 000 dollars to 28 000 dollars per QALY for other genotypes; and for women ranged from 32 000 dollars to 90 000 dollars for genotype 1 and from 12 000 dollars to 42 000 dollars for other genotypes. Because the benefits of treatment were realized largely in the form of improvements in health-related quality of life, rather than prolonged survivorship, cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as dollars per year of life were substantially higher. Results were most sensitive to assumptions about the gains and decrements in health-related quality of life associated with treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: While newer treatment options for hepatitis C appear to be reasonably cost-effective on average, these results vary widely across different patient subgroups and depend critically on quality-of-life assumptions. As the pool of persons eligible for treatment for HCV infection expands to the more general population, it will be imperative for patients and their physicians to consider these assumptions in making individual-level treatment decisions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heat related mortality is of great concern for public health, and estimates of future mortality under a warming climate are important for planning of resources and possible adaptation measures. Papers providing projections of future heat-related mortality were critically reviewed with a focus on the use of climate model data. Some best practice guidelines are proposed for future research.
METHODS: The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality. The search was limited to papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals up to the end of March 2017. Reference lists of relevant papers and the citing literature were also examined. The wide range of locations studied and climate data used prevented a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 608 articles were identified after removal of duplicate entries, of which 63 were found to contain a quantitative estimate of future mortality from hot days or heat waves. A wide range of mortality models and climate model data have been used to estimate future mortality. Temperatures in the climate simulations used in these studies were projected to increase. Consequently, all the papers indicated that mortality from high temperatures would increase under a warming climate. The spread in projections of future climate by models adds substantial uncertainty to estimates of future heat-related mortality. However, many studies either did not consider this source of uncertainty, or only used results from a small number of climate models. Other studies showed that uncertainty from changes in populations and demographics, and the methods for adaptation to warmer temperatures were at least as important as climate model uncertainty. Some inconsistencies in the use of climate data (for example, using global mean temperature changes instead of changes for specific locations) and interpretation of the effects on mortality were apparent. Some factors which have not been considered when estimating future mortality are summarised.
CONCLUSIONS: Most studies have used climate data generated using scenarios with medium and high emissions of greenhouse gases. More estimates of future mortality using climate information from the mitigation scenario RCP2.6 are needed, as this scenario is the only one under which the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2°C or less could be realised. Many of the methods used to combine modelled data with local climate observations are simplistic. Quantile-based methods might offer an improved approach, especially for temperatures at the ends of the distributions. The modelling of adaptation to warmer temperatures in mortality models is generally arbitrary and simplistic, and more research is needed to better quantify adaptation. Only a small number of studies included possible changes in population and demographics in their estimates of future mortality, meaning many estimates of mortality could be biased low. Uncertainty originating from establishing a mortality baseline, climate projections, adaptation and population changes is important and should be considered when estimating future mortality.},

  abstract = {We explore the ability of a simple urban surface parametrization, embedded in a mesoscale meteorological model, to correctly reproduce observed values of the urban heat island (UHI) intensity, which is defined as the urban-rural surface air temperature difference. To do so, a simple urban scheme was incorporated into the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS). Subsequently, a simulation was performed with the coupled model over the wider area of Paris, for a 12-day period in June 2006 that was characterised by conditions prone to UHI development. Simulated 2-m air temperature was compared with observed values for urban and rural stations, yielding mean errors of 1.4 and 1.5 K, respectively. More importantly, it was found that the model also displayed an overall good capability of reproducing the observed temperature differences. In particular, the magnitude (up to 6 K) and timing of the diurnal cycle of the UHI intensity was simulated well, the model exhibiting a mean error of 1.15 K. As a result, our conclusion is that the ARPS model, extended with simple urban surface physics, is able to capture observed urban-rural air temperature differences well, at least for the domain and period studied.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Streptococcus pneumoniae Invasive Disease network (SpIDnet) actively monitors populations in nine sites in seven European countries for invasive pneumococcal disease. Five sites use 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) alone and four use the ten-valent PCV (PCV10) and PCV13. Vaccination uptake is greater than 90\% in six sites and 67-78\% in three sites. We measured the effects of introducing high-valency PCVs on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years.
METHODS: We compared the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in each of the 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13 with the average incidence during the preceding period of heptavalent PCV (PCV7) use, overall and by serotype category. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95\% CIs for each year and pooled the values for all sites in a random effects meta-analysis.
FINDINGS: 4 years after the introduction of PCV13 alone or PCV10 and PCV13, the pooled IRR was 0·53 (95\% CI 0·43-0·65) for invasive pneumococcal disease in children younger than 5 years caused by any serotype, 0·16 (0·07-0·40) for disease caused by PCV7 serotypes, 0·17 (0·07-0·42) for disease caused by 1, 5, and 7F serotypes, and 0·41 (0·25-0·69) for that caused by 3, 6A and 19A serotypes. We saw a similar pattern when we restricted the analysis to sites where only PCV13 was used. The pooled IRR for invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes was 1·62 (1·09-2·42).
INTERPRETATION: The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by all serotypes decreased due to a decline in the incidence of vaccine serotypes. By contrast, that of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased, which suggests serotype replacement. Long-term surveillance will be crucial to monitor the further effects of PCV10 and PCV13 vaccination programmes in young children.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) and 69th World Health Assembly approved the first global health sector strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis with the goal to eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections worldwide. The aim is a 90\% reduction of new infections and 65\% reduction of HCV-related deaths by 2030.
AIM: This study reports on the epidemiology of HCV infections in the Austrian state of Tyrol (total population 750,000) and uses a predictive model to identify how the WHO strategy for elimination of HCV can be achieved.
METHODS: We developed a regional disease burden model based on observed local diagnosis data from 2001 to 2016. Scenarios were developed to evaluate the impact of diagnosis and treatment on HCV-related outcomes (viremic prevalence, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related deaths) from 2015 through 2030.
RESULTS: In the last 15 years, 1,721 patients living in Tyrol have been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection. When ageing, mortality and treatment were factored in, there were an estimated 2,043 viremic HCV infections in 2016, of which 1,136 cases had been diagnosed. A baseline model predicts a decrease of 588 HCV cases from 2015 to 2030, which would not translate into the significant reduction of infections needed to achieve WHO global health recommendations. A total of 1,843 infected individuals need to be identified and treated to achieve the WHO goals by 2030 (1,254 averted cases as compared to baseline model). Implementation of this strategy would avoid 523 new HCV infections and decreases HCV-related mortality by 73\%.
CONCLUSION: HCV elimination and {$>$}65\% reduction of associated mortality are possible for Tyrol, but requires a significant increase in new diagnoses and treatment rate. The model presented in this study could serve as an example for other regions to reliably predict regional disease burden and estimate how WHO goals can be met in the future.},

Data on food exposure of 62\% (317/510) of the patient and resident cohort were available for a simultaneous retrospective cohort study. The case-cohort analysis revealed that consumption of sliced cold sausage offered on 15 March [odds ratio (OR): 3.98; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-14.1], a meat dish with salad (adjusted OR: 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.19-4.08) and a rolled spinach pancake (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95\% CI: 1.27-3.71) on 16 March were independent risk factors.

The summary estimates yielded an IRR 0.10 [0.04; 0.30] suggesting a 90\%, incidence reduction. Heterogeneity was high with I(2)=93\%. Heterogeneity might be explained by, differences in vaccination rates, the way vaccination rates were assessed, matching of the periods of, vaccination and case ascertainment, time between onset of the vaccination programme and onset of, case ascertainment during the vaccination period and the length of the observation period after onset, of the vaccination programme.

On average, the cumulative incidences calculated by the nonparametric backprojection method are about 15\% lower than the results from the step function model. Nonparametric backprojection with the Hessol incubation distribution suggests a declining HIV infection rate after 1985, as might be expected from German health policies.

  abstract = {A seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduced in the United States in 2000 has been shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in both vaccinated children and adults through induction of herd immunity. We assessed the impact of infant immunization on pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and mortality in all age groups using Health Care Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases (SID) for 1996 to 2006 from 10 states; SID contain 100\% samples of ICD9-coded hospitalization data for the selected states. Compared to a 1996–1997 through 1998–1999 baseline, by the 2005–2006 season, both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and deaths had decreased substantially in all age groups, including a 47\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 38 to 54\%) reduction in nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (ICD9 code 481 with no codes indicating IPD) in infants {$<$}2 years old and a 54\% reduction (CI, 53 to 56\%) in adults ≥65 years of age. A model developed to calculate the total burden of pneumococcal pneumonia prevented by infant PCV7 vaccination in the United States from 2000 to 2006 estimated a reduction of 788,838 (CI, 695,406 to 875,476) hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia. Ninety percent of the reduction in model-attributed pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations occurred through herd immunity among adults 18 years old and older; similar proportions were found in pneumococcal disease mortality prevented by the vaccine. In the first seasons after PCV introduction, when there were substantial state differences in coverage among {$<$}5-year-olds, states with greater coverage had significantly fewer influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among children, suggesting that PCV7 use also reduces influenza-attributable pneumonia hospitalizations.
IMPORTANCE Pneumonia is the world’s leading cause of death in children and the leading infectious cause of death among U.S. adults 65 years old and older. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of infants has previously been shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among seniors through prevention of pneumococcal transmission from infants to adults (herd immunity). Our analysis documents a significant vaccine-associated reduction not only in IPD but also in pneumococcal pneumonia hospitalizations and inpatient mortality rates among both vaccinated children and unvaccinated adults. We estimate that fully 90\% of the reduction in the pneumonia hospitalization burden occurred among adults. Moreover, states that more rapidly introduced their infant pneumococcal immunization programs had greater reductions in influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalization of children, presumably because the vaccine acts to prevent the pneumococcal pneumonia that frequently follows influenza virus infection. Our results indicate that seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use has yielded far greater benefits through herd immunity than have previously been recognized.},

  abstract = {In Spain, whole cell pertussis vaccination started in 1975, with three doses before the age of 6-7 months. Doses at 15-18 months and 4-6 years were introduced in 1996 and 2001, respectively. Spain switched to an acellular vaccine in 2005. From 1998 to 2009, pertussis incidence rates remained ≤1.5 cases/100,000 inhabitants but increased from 2010 to 7.5 cases/100,000 in 2012. Data from 1998 to 2012 were analysed to assess disease trends and susceptible populations. We defined four epidemic periods: 1998-2001 (reference), 2002-05, 2006-09 and 2010-12. In 2002-05, the incidence rate increased in individuals aged 15-49 years (IRR: 1.41 (95\% CI: 1.11-1.78)) and ≥50 years (IRR: 2.78 (95\% CI: 1.78-4.33)) and in 2006-09 increased also in infants aged {$<$}3 months (IRR: 1.83 (95\% CI: 1.60-2.09)). In 2010-12, the incidence rate increased notably in all age groups, with IRRs ranging between 2.5 (95\% CI: 2.3-2.8) in 5-9 year-olds and 36.0 (95\% CI: 19.4-66.8) in 20-29 year-olds. These results, consistent with the country's vaccination history, suggest a progressive accumulation of susceptible individuals due to waning immunity after years of low incidence. Further vaccination strategies should be assessed and implemented to prevent pertussis in pre-vaccinated infants, in whom the disease is more severe.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite successful vaccination programs, pertussis remains endemic in the United States, and increasing incidence has been reported. We used national surveillance data to describe pertussis epidemiology, including patient demographic characteristics, geographic distribution, and temporal trends.
METHODS: We included cases reported through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2016. Differences in case characteristics were compared using Pearson χ2. Average annual incidence (cases per 100 000 population) was calculated overall and by age ({$<$}1 year, 1-6 years, 7-10 years, 11-18 years, 19-39 years, 30-64 years, and ≥65 years) and geographic subgroup. Annual percent change was estimated using negative bionomial regression.
RESULTS: During 2000-2016, 339 420 pertussis cases were reported. The majority were in white (88.2\%) and non-Hispanic (81.3\%) persons, 9.9\% were hospitalized, and 0.1\% were fatal; however, differences existed by age. Infants had the highest incidence (75.3/100 000 population), accounting for 88.8\% of deaths. Incidence increased significantly over time (P = .0019), increases were observed for all groups except persons aged {$<$}1 year and 19-64 years. Elevated case counts among persons aged 7-10 and 11-18 years coincided with the aging of acellular-primed cohorts. Incidence varied by geographic region, with some similarities in disease cyclicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing baseline incidence and changing age distribution of pertussis suggest a central role of the transition to acellular vaccines in the US disease resurgence. Continued monitoring of national data is important to evaluate and optimize pertussis prevention and control strategies.},

Current acellular vaccines against Bordetella pertussis are effective in preventing severe disease but have little effect on less severe coughing illness that can mediate transmission.
METHODS: Using mice that are natural host's of Bordetella bronchiseptica, we determined the effects of vaccination on shedding and transmission of this pathogen.
RESULTS: Vaccination with heat-killed whole-cell B. bronchiseptica or B. pertussis inhibited shedding of B. bronchiseptica. Differences in neutrophil and B-cell recruitment distinguished sham-vaccine from whole-cell-----vaccine responses and correlated with shedding output. Both B and T cells were essential for vaccine-induced control of shedding. Adoptive transfer of antibodies was able to limit shedding, while depletion of CD4(+) T cells led to increased shedding in vaccinated mice. Finally, whole-cell vaccination was able to prevent transmission, but an acellular vaccine that effectively controls disease failed to control shedding and transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight discrepancies between whole-cell and acellular vaccination that could contribute to the increased incidence of B. pertussis infection since the transition to the use of acellular vaccination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have shown increased risk of mortality from elevated temperatures for adults, limited studies have examined temperature's effect on mortality for infants. Our study investigated the city-specific and overall effects of ambient temperature on infant mortality in seven major cities in Korea, 2004-2007.
METHODS: Birth cohort using a linked birth and death records included 777,570 births with 557 all-cause deaths. We estimated city-specific hazard ratios for each city using an extended Cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates. Then we combined city-specific hazard ratios to generate overall hazard ratio across the seven cities using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Stratified analyses were conducted by cause of death (total and SIDS), exposure period (whole gestation, each trimester, lifetime, 1 month before death, and 2 weeks before death), sex, and maternal characteristics.
RESULTS: Overall across the cities, we found significantly positive associations between ambient temperature during 1 month before death or 2 weeks before death and infant mortality from total or SIDS. The overall hazard ratio of infant mortality from total deaths and SIDS for a 1°C increase during 1 month before death was 1.52 (95\% CI, 1.46-1.57) and 1.50 (95\% CI, 1.35-1.66), respectively. We also found suggestive evidence that some factors such as mother's age may modify the association.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for establishment of policy to reduce the risk of infant mortality from high ambient temperature under climate change.},

The registration number is PROSPERO-CRD42016047179. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Global Health were systematically searched to identify systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed quality. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of included systematic reviews. Estimates of morbidity and mortality risk in association with heat exposure, cold exposure, heatwaves, cold spells and diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs) were the primary outcomes. Twenty-eight systematic reviews were included in the overview of systematic reviews. (i) The median (interquartile range) AMSTAR scores were 7 (1.75) for quantitative reviews and 3.5 (1.75) for qualitative reviews. (ii) Heat exposure was identified to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality, but was not found to have an impact on cardiovascular or cerebrovascular morbidity. (iii) Reanalysis of the meta-analyses indicated that cold-induced cardiovascular morbidity increased in youth and middle-age (RR=1.009, 95\% CI: 1.004-1.015) as well as the elderly (RR=1.013, 95\% CI: 1.007-1.018). (iv) The definitions of temperature exposure adopted by different studies included various temperature indicators and thresholds. In conclusion, heat exposure seemed to have an adverse effect on mortality and cold-induced cardiovascular morbidity increased in the elderly. Developing definitions of temperature exposure at the regional level may contribute to more accurate evaluations of the health effects of temperature.},

We present methods for obtaining point and interval estimates of partial PARs, where the impact on disease burden for some presumably modifiable determinants is estimated in, and applied to, a cohort study. When the disease is multifactorial, the partial PAR must, in general, be used to quantify the proportion of disease which can be prevented if a specific exposure or group of exposures is eliminated from a target population, while the distribution of other modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors is unchanged. The methods are illustrated in a study of risk factors for bladder cancer incidence (Michaud DS et al., New England J Med 340 (1999) 1390).

  abstract = {The introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in the childhood immunisation programme in Norway in 2006 substantially decreased the incidence of vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in all age groups. Additionally, a slight increase in the non-vaccine (NVT) serotype IPD incidence (serotype replacement) was observed. After replacing PCV7 with PCV13 in 2011, a further decrease in IPD incidence is expected. However, the protection by the six additional serotypes opens new nasopharyngeal niches for colonisation, which favours conditions for serotype replacement. Close monitoring of IPD therefore remains important in order to quickly detect changes. In this observational retrospective population-based cohort study we used data notified nationally between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2012 to determine the VT- and NVT-IPD incidences. The diversity in serotype distribution per year was analysed using the Simpson's index of diversity. Immunisation history of young children was obtained from the Norwegian Vaccination Registry to determine vaccine failure. The incidence of VT-IPD decreased in the targeted ({$<$}5 years) and non-targeted (≥5) age groups since PCV7 introduction and further decreased after the replacement with PCV13. Only two cases of vaccine failure were identified. This indicates very high effectiveness of the 2+1 schedules with PCV7 or PCV13 and suggests that non-vaccinated individuals profit through indirect protection. The decrease in incidence of PCV7-IPD in non-targeted age groups became larger in later years, indicating a lag phase for the indirect effects, and suggests that the indirect protection of PCV13 will increase in coming years. The incidence of some NVT, specifically serotypes 23B and 15A, increased after PCV13 introduction. This coincided with an increased Simpson's index of diversity in the targeted age group. As this suggests that serotype replacement is again occurring, continues monitoring of IPD is important so that adaptations to vaccine recommendations can be promptly issued.},

  abstract = {Two different vaccines, a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and a 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13), are available for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the population aged 65 years and older (65+). The IPD epidemiology in the 65+ is undergoing change due to indirect effects of childhood immunisation. Vaccine recommendations for the 65+ must take into account these trends in epidemiology. We therefore explored the preventive potential of vaccination strategies to prevent IPD in the 65+, including PPV23, PCV13 or PCV13+PPV23 in 2014–2019. Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted to 2004–2014 population-wide surveillance data and used to predict incidences for vaccine-type and non-vaccine type IPD. We determined the number of people needed to be vaccinated to prevent one case per season (NNV) for each strategy and estimated the public health impact on the IPD case counts from increasing the vaccine uptake to 28–45\%. Our results indicate that PCV13-IPD will decrease by 71\% from 58 (95\% prediction interval 55–61) cases in 2014/15 to 17 (6–52) in 2018/19 and PPV23-IPD by 32\% from 168 (162–175) to 115 (49–313) cases. The NNV will increase over time for all strategies because of a decreasing vaccine-type IPD incidence. In 2018/19, the PCV13-NNV will be 5.3 times higher than the PPV23-NNV. Increasing the vaccine uptake will lead to a larger public health impact for all scenarios. Combining PCV13 and PPV23 is most effective, but the additional effect of PCV13 will decrease and is only marginal in 2018/19. Our study demonstrates the importance of increasing PPV23 uptake and of developing vaccines that confer broader immunity.},

Past studies demonstrate links between O3 exposure and health. However, knowledge gaps remain in our understanding concerning the impacts of climate change mitigation policies on O3 concentrations and health. Using a hybrid downscaling approach, we evaluated the separate impact of climate change and emission control policies on O3 levels and associated excess mortality in the US in the 2050s under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We show that, by the 2050s, under RCP4.5, increased O3 levels due to combined climate change and emission control policies, could contribute to an increase of approximately 50 premature deaths annually nationwide in the US. The biggest impact, however, is seen under RCP8.5, where rises in O3 concentrations are expected to result in over 2,200 additional premature deaths annually. The largest increases in O3 are seen in RCP8.5 in the Northeast, the Southeast, the Central, and the West regions of the US. Additionally, when O3 increases are examined by climate change and emissions contributions separately, the benefits of emissions mitigation efforts may significantly outweigh the effects of climate change mitigation policies on O3-related mortality.},

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis in children worldwide. Despite available evidence on pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) impact on pneumonia hospitalizations in children, studies demonstrating PCV impact in morbidity and mortality in middle-income countries are still scarce. Given the disease burden, PCV7 was introduced in Peru in 2009, and then switched to PCV10 in late 2011. National public healthcare system provides care for 60\% of the population, and national hospitalization, outpatient and mortality data are available. We thus aimed to assess the effects of routine PCV vaccination on pneumonia hospitalization and mortality, and acute otitis media (AOM) and all cause pneumonia outpatient visits in children under one year of age in Peru. We conducted a segmented time-series analysis using outcome-specific regression models. Study period was from January 2006 to December 2012. Data sources included the National information systems for hospitalization, mortality, outpatient visits, and RENACE, the national database of aggregated weekly notifications of pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases (both hospitalized and non-hospitalized). Study outcomes included community acquired pneumonia outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deaths (ICD10 codes J12-J18); and AOM outpatient visits (H65-H67). Monthly age- and sex-specific admission, outpatient visit, and mortality rates per 100,000 children aged {$<$}1year, as well as weekly rates for pneumonia and AOM recorded in RENACE were estimated. After PCV introduction, we observed significant vaccine impact in morbidity and mortality in children aged {$<$}1year. Vaccine effectiveness was 26.2\% (95\% CI 16.9-34.4) for AOM visits, 35\% (95\% CI 8.6-53.8) for mortality due to pneumonia, and 20.6\% (95\% CI 10.6-29.5) for weekly cases of pneumonia hospitalization and outpatient visits notified to RENACE. We used secondary data sources which are usually developed for other non-epidemiologic purposes. Despite some data limitations, our results clearly demonstrate the overall benefit of PCV vaccination in Peru.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of molecular diagnostic techniques for the evaluation of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) has not been documented. We aimed to evaluate the impact of PCVs on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and compare with results obtained from culture-based methods.
METHODS: We implemented two independent surveillance programs for IPD among individuals hospitalized at one large surveillance site in Soweto, South Africa during 2009-2012: (i) PCR-based (targeting the lytA gene) syndromic pneumonia surveillance; and (ii) culture-based laboratory surveillance. Positive samples were serotyped. The molecular serotyping assay included targets for 42 serotypes including all serotypes/serogroups included in the 7-valent (PCV-7) and 13-valent (PCV-13) PCV. The Quellung reaction was used for serotyping of culture-positive cases. We calculated the change in rates of IPD (lytA- or culture-positive) among HIV-uninfected children aged {$<$}2 years from the year of PCV-7 introduction (2009) to the post-vaccine years (2011 or 2012).
RESULTS: During the study period there were 607 lytA-positive and 1,197 culture-positive cases that were serotyped. Samples with lytA cycle threshold (Ct)-values ≥35 (30.2 \%; 123/407) were significantly less likely to have a serotype/serogroup detected for serotypes included in the molecular serotyping assay than those with Ct-values {$<$}35 (78.0 \%; 156/200) (p {$<$} 0.001). From 2009 to 2012 rates of PCV-7 serotypes/serogroups decreased -63.8 \% (95 \% CI: -79.3 \% to -39.1 \%) among lytA-positive cases and -91.7 \% (95 \% CI: -98.8 \% to -73.6 \%) among culture-positive cases. Rates of lytA-positive non-vaccine serotypes/serogroups also significantly decreased (-71.7 \%; 95 \% CI: -81.1 \% to -58.5 \%) over the same period. Such decline was not observed among the culture-positive non-vaccine serotypes (1.2 \%; 95 \% CI: -96.7 \% to 58.4 \%).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant downward trends in IPD PCV-7 serotype-associated rates were observed among patients tested by PCR or culture methods; however trends of non-vaccine serotypes/serogroups differed between the two groups. Misclassifications of serotypes/serogroups, affecting the use of non-vaccine serotypes as a control group, may have occurred due to the low performance of the serotyping assay among lytA-positive cases with high Ct-values. Until PCR methods improve further, culture methods should continue to be used to monitor the effects of PCV vaccination programs on IPD incidence.},

The colonization of the nasopharynx is prerequisite for their transmission and the colonization of toddlers are an important reservoir also for infections in the elderly. Since pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce the colonization rate of children its widespread use has also resulted in a reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. Advanced age and comorbidity are the most important risk factors for pneumococcal pneumonia and the mortality in this risk group is still very high. The strongest risk factor for invasive pneumococcal infections, however, is HIV/AIDS and solid or hematologic malignancies. A more rapid identification could aid de-escalation of empiric antibiotic therapy. The pneumococcal urinary antigen test, however lacks sensitivity for this purpose. In contrast, the direct identification of pathogens from positive blood culture bottles by MALDI-TOF is a very encouraging development in diagnostic microbiology. In several cohort studies patients treated with a combination of a betalactam plus macrolide had a lower mortality than patients treated with betalactam monotherapy. If these observations reflect a truly beneficial effect of combination therapy or rather confounding of the studies remains unclear and evidence from interventional studies is needed.},

Following the identification of rubella, which similarly presents with fever and rash and causes congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in infants born to women first infected with rubella early in pregnancy, modelers also began to characterize rubella disease and transmission. Despite the relatively large literature, no comprehensive review to date provides an overview of dynamic transmission models for measles and rubella developed to support risk and policy analysis. This systematic review of the literature identifies quantitative measles and/or rubella dynamic transmission models and characterizes key insights relevant for prospective modeling efforts. Overall, measles and rubella represent some of the relatively simplest viruses to model due to their ability to impact only humans and the apparent life-long immunity that follows survival of infection and/or protection by vaccination, although complexities arise due to maternal antibodies and heterogeneity in mixing and some models considered potential waning immunity and reinfection. This review finds significant underreporting of measles and rubella infections and widespread recognition of the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity to stop and prevent measles and rubella transmission. The significantly lower transmissibility of rubella compared to measles implies that all countries could eliminate rubella and CRS by using combination of measles- and rubella-containing vaccines (MRCVs) as they strive to meet regional measles elimination goals, which leads to the recommendation of changing the formulation of national measles-containing vaccines from measles only to MRCV as the standard of care.},

  abstract = {Objectives To assess the heterogeneity of heatwave-related impacts on mortality across different cities.
Design A multicity time series study.
Setting 3 largest Australian cities: Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.
Participants All residents living in these cities.
Main outcome measures Non-external causes mortality data by gender and two age groups (ie, 0–75 and 75+) for these cities during the period 1988–2009 were obtained from relevant government agencies.
Results Total mortality increased mostly within the same day (lag 0) or a lag of 1 day (lag 1) during almost all heatwaves in three cities. Using the heatwave definition (HWD) as the 95th centile of mean temperature for two or more consecutive days in the summer season, the relative risk for total mortality at lag 1 in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney was 1.13 (95\% CI 1.08 to 1.19), 1.10 (95\% CI 1.06 to 1.14) and 1.06 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.10), respectively. Using the more stringent HWD—the 99th centile of mean temperature for two or more consecutive days, the relative risk of total mortality at the lags of 0–2 days in Brisbane and Melbourne was 1.40 (95\% CI 1.29 to 1.51) and 1.47 (95\% CI 1.36 to 1.59), respectively. Elderly, particularly females, were more vulnerable to the impact of heatwaves.
Conclusions A consistent and significant increase in mortality was observed during heatwaves in the three largest Australian cities, but the impacts of heatwave appeared to vary with age, gender, the HWD and geographical area.},

Conjugate vaccines have been developed against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae to provide improved immune responses. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of vaccine-type pneumococcal diseases in children, including invasive disease and pneumonia and acute otitis media. There have also been significant declines in antimicrobial resistance in 7-valent vaccine serotypes and carriage of S. pneumoniae in the post-PCV7 era. Two to three years after the introduction of PCV13, there is emerging, global evidence of a reduced burden of pneumococcal diseases in children, including declines in IPD (UK and Germany) and nasopharyngeal carriage of PCV13 serotypes (Portugal and France). The functional immunogenicity of PCV13 in individuals ≥ 50 years of age has been demonstrated in clinical trials in comparison with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and for children and adults 6 to 49 years of age. Between 2011 and 2013, PCV13 received market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for these additional age groups and is now available in Europe for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in all age groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-induced antibody responses and protection against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis media (AOM) is unclear. This study assessed the impact of the ten-valent pneumococcal nontypable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) on these end points. The primary objective was to demonstrate vaccine efficacy (VE) in a per-protocol analysis against likely bacterial CAP (B-CAP: radiologically confirmed CAP with alveolar consolidation/pleural effusion on chest X-ray, or non-alveolar infiltrates and C-reactive protein ≥ 40 µg/ml); other protocol-specified outcomes were also assessed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This phase III double-blind randomized controlled study was conducted between 28 June 2007 and 28 July 2011 in Argentine, Panamanian, and Colombian populations with good access to health care. Approximately 24,000 infants received PHiD-CV or hepatitis control vaccine (hepatitis B for primary vaccination, hepatitis A at booster) at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 mo of age. Interim analysis of the primary end point was planned when 535 first B-CAP episodes, occurring ≥2 wk after dose 3, were identified in the per-protocol cohort. After a mean follow-up of 23 mo (PHiD-CV, n = 10,295; control, n = 10,201), per-protocol VE was 22.0\% (95\% CI: 7.7, 34.2; one-sided p = 0.002) against B-CAP (conclusive for primary objective) and 25.7\% (95\% CI: 8.4\%, 39.6\%) against World Health Organization-defined consolidated CAP. Intent-to-treat VE was 18.2\% (95\% CI: 5.5\%, 29.1\%) against B-CAP and 23.4\% (95\% CI: 8.8\%, 35.7\%) against consolidated CAP. End-of-study per-protocol analyses were performed after a mean follow-up of 28-30 mo for CAP and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (PHiD-CV, n = 10,211; control, n = 10,140) and AOM (n = 3,010 and 2,979, respectively). Per-protocol VE was 16.1\% (95\% CI: -1.1\%, 30.4\%; one-sided p = 0.032) against clinically confirmed AOM, 67.1\% (95\% CI: 17.0\%, 86.9\%) against vaccine serotype clinically confirmed AOM, 100\% (95\% CI: 74.3\%, 100\%) against vaccine serotype IPD, and 65.0\% (95\% CI: 11.1\%, 86.2\%) against any IPD. Results were consistent between intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Serious adverse events were reported for 21.5\% (95\% CI: 20.7\%, 22.2\%) and 22.6\% (95\% CI: 21.9\%, 23.4\%) of PHiD-CV and control recipients, respectively. There were 19 deaths (n = 11,798; 0.16\%) in the PHiD-CV group and 26 deaths (n = 11,799; 0.22\%) in the control group. A significant study limitation was the lower than expected number of captured AOM cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy was demonstrated against a broad range of pneumococcal diseases commonly encountered in young children in clinical practice.

  abstract = {Much interest has surrounded the use of conjugate vaccines in recent years, with the development of vaccines against disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These vaccines offer the potential for safe and effective disease control, but some questions remain, particularly regarding the duration and mechanisms of protection and the longer-term impact of vaccination on carriage. In this paper, the authors use data on immunization with serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccines in England and Wales to develop and apply a mathematical model to investigate the direct and indirect (herd immunity) effects of a conjugate vaccine program. A realistic, age-structured, dynamic model was developed and parameterized and was fitted to epidemiologic data from England and Wales. The effects of a range of vaccine strategies, including hypothetical scenarios, were investigated. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 1.36. Catch-up vaccination targeting teenagers generated substantial herd immunity and was important in controlling disease rapidly. The results were sensitive to changes in the assumptions regarding the method of vaccine action, particularly duration of protection and efficacy of vaccination against carriage acquisition. This model can be used to help predict the potential impact of vaccine strategies both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases are major causes of morbidity among adults, especially those over 50years of age. While pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCV's) impact on pneumococcal disease rates among children is well established, the extent of its impact on adult pneumococcal related illness remains unclear. The aim of this systematic literature review was to describe the impact of PCV introduction to childhood national immunization programs worldwide on PCV-naive adult population.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed database. The search was limited to articles written in English and published between January 2000 and February 2016. Studies evaluating pneumococcal disease rates in individuals over 5years of age were included. Independent extraction of articles was performed by the two authors. Search terms included: Pneumococcal conjugated vaccine, herd, indirect, adults, and pneumonia.
RESULTS: Forty-nine articles meeting the selection criteria were identified, 39 regarding invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD, one on meningitis only), 8 regarding pneumonia, and 2 on both IPD and pneumonia. The majority of reports were from the US, UK and Canada. Considerable variability in the data sources, quality and completeness was observed. While most studies reported either statistically significant reduction or insignificant changes in IPD and pneumonia disease rates in adults following PCV nationwide implementation, few studies reported statistically significant increase in pneumococcal disease rates, these were mainly from countries with low PCV coverage rates and/or inadequate surveillance.
CONCLUSION: Invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia rates among the adult population decreased in most countries following PCV introduction into the NIP. This indirect effect on older population seems to be dependent on PCV coverage rates and time from PCV nationwide implementation. Adults {$>$}65years old seem to benefit the most from PCV introduction.},

  abstract = {The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme is a collaboration with 18 member countries (2001/02) which monitors the activity and impact of influenza by collecting morbidity and virological data in primary care facilities throughout the winter season each year. Despite being in principle similar in the surveillance concept, the indicators used and observations made are very different. Different healthcare systems and organisational needs (eg a certificate of illness for the employer) influence the consultation behaviour. Furthermore, and partly as a result of differences in the healthcare systems, the definitions used for the numerator and denominator when calculating morbidity rates are different. Thus comparative interpretation of participating countries\&apos; morbidity data is extremely difficult. Reporting \&apos;harmonisation\&apos; by using equivalent numerators and denominators is one option but is difficult to achieve in the short term. Moreover, several additional issues would need to be considered, for example, the need for continuity of surveillance and whether such steps would indeed result in direct comparability etc. A simple index was tested, through which the impact of influenza morbidity in any one year is compared with what is considered a \&apos;usual\&apos; epidemic in that country. The index in principle describes numerically the extent to which the influenza-attributable excess morbidity in the current epidemic in each country is within, exceeds, or is less than a range typical for an influenza epidemic. In this pilot study, the usefulness of such an index is explored with the example of eight countries for the seasons 1999/2000 and 2000/01. A fine tuning of the methods has not yet been performed.},

OBJECTIVES: We measured the lag effects of temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on hospitalizations and deaths for HF in elderly diagnosed with this disease on a 10-year period in the province of Quebec, Canada.
METHODS: Our population-based cohort study included 112,793 elderly diagnosed with HF between 2001 and 2011. Time dependent Cox regression models approximated with pooled logistic regressions were used to evaluate the 3- and 7-day lag effects of daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and PM2.5 exposure on HF morbidity and mortality controlling for several individual and contextual covariates.
RESULTS: Overall, 18,309 elderly were hospitalized and 4297 died for the main cause of HF. We observed an increased risk of hospitalizations and deaths for HF with a decrease in the average temperature of the 3 and 7days before the event. An increase in atmospheric pressure in the previous 7days was also associated with a higher risk of having a HF negative outcome, but no effect was observed in the 3-day lag model. No association was found with relative humidity and with PM2.5 regardless of the lag period.
CONCLUSIONS: Lag effects of temperature and other meteorological parameters on HF events were limited but present. Nonetheless, preventive measures should be issued for elderly diagnosed with HF considering the burden and the expensive costs associated with the management of this disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study presents an analysis of 1,491 serogroup 23 and 762 serogroup 15 isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and adults before and after the general recommendation for childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Germany in July 2006. Vaccination formulations used were PCV7 (from July 2006), PCV10 (from April 2009) and PCV13 (from December 2009, replacing PCV7).
METHODS: The German National Reference Center for Streptococci (GNRCS) has conducted surveillance of IPD since 1992. Isolates were serotyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Selected isolates were characterized using MLST.
RESULTS: In an analysis of 23,957 isolates from IPD in children and adults sent to the GNRCS between July 1992 and June 2014, we found a strongly significant increase of non-PCV13 serotypes in the late vaccination (PCV13) period (2010-2014). Among these, the proportions of serotypes 15A and 23B were the most strongly significantly increasing. After the recommendation for pneumococcal conjugate childhood vaccination in 2006 and the introduction of higher-valent vaccines in 2009, the proportion of 15A increased significantly from 0.5\% in the early vaccination period (2007-2010) to 2.4\% in the late vaccination period (2010-2014, p=3.14 x 10(-22)). The proportion of serotype 23B increased from 0.5\% to 2.8\% in the same period (p=1.55 x 10(-29)). Penicillin non-susceptibility levels of the serotype 15A (47.4\%) and serotype 23B (46.5\%) isolates were high, with MIC values ranging from 0.12-2 μg/ml (15A) and 0.12-0.5 μg/ml (23B). MLSTs of serotype 23B isolates grouped in two clonal complexes (CC): CC439, with sequence type (ST) 439 as the main representative and CC338 (linked to CC156), with ST1349 as most prevalent clone. Both CCs have been present over almost the whole surveillance period. All penicillin non-susceptible isolates occurred in CC338. Serotype 15A isolates appeared to be more diverse. Six CCs, one group of three STs and two singletons were found among 20 isolates. Most prevalent was CC63, with ST63 as most prominent representative (n=5). Most penicillin non-susceptible isolates were found among CC63 isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of non-PCV13 serotypes in Germany has increased significantly between July 2007 and June 2014, with 15A and 23B being the most strongly increasing serotypes of all. Both serotypes show a high proportion of penicillin non-susceptibility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In South Africa, a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2009 with a three-dose schedule for infants at 6, 14, and 36 weeks of age; a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) replaced PCV7 in 2011. In 2012, it was estimated that 81\% of 12-month-old children had received three doses of vaccine. We assessed the effect of vaccination on invasive pneumococcal disease.
METHODS: We conducted national, active, laboratory-based surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease. We calculated the change in the incidence of the disease from a prevaccine (baseline) period (2005 through 2008) to postvaccine years 2011 and 2012, with a focus on high-risk age groups.
RESULTS: Surveillance identified 35,192 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. The rates among children younger than 2 years of age declined from 54.8 to 17.0 cases per 100,000 person-years from the baseline period to 2012, including a decline from 32.1 to 3.4 cases per 100,000 person-years in disease caused by PCV7 serotypes (-89\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -92 to -86). Among children not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the estimated incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by PCV7 serotypes decreased by 85\% (95\% CI, -89 to -79), whereas disease caused by nonvaccine serotypes increased by 33\% (95\% CI, 15 to 48). Among adults 25 to 44 years of age, the rate of PCV7-serotype disease declined by 57\% (95\% CI, -63 to -50), from 3.7 to 1.6 cases per 100,000 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease among children in South Africa fell substantially by 2012. Reductions in the rates of disease caused by PCV7 serotypes among both children and adults most likely reflect the direct and indirect effects of vaccination.

  abstract = {Mortality monitoring systems are important for gauging the effect of influenza and other wide ranging health threats. We present the daily all-cause mortality monitoring system routinely used in Scotland, which differs from others by using two different statistical models for calculating expected mortality. The first model is an extended Serfling model, which captures annual seasonality in mortality using sine and cosine terms, and is frequently seen in other systems. Serfling models fit to summer seasonality well, but not to the winter peak. Thus, during the winter, there are frequent 'excesses', higher than expected mortality, making it harder to directly judge if winter mortality is higher than in previous years. The second model, a Generalised Additive Model, resolves this by allowing a more flexible seasonal pattern that includes the winter peak. Thus, excesses under the second model directly indicate if winter mortality is higher than in previous years, useful, for example, in judging if a new strain of seasonal influenza is more likely to produce death than previous ones. As common in all-cause mortality monitoring systems, the Scottish system uses a reporting delay correction: we discuss the difficulties of interpretation when such a correction is used and possible avenues for future work that may address these difficulties.},

  abstract = {In Austria, vaccination coverage against Bordetella pertussis infections during infancy is estimated at around 90\%. Within the last years, however, the number of pertussis cases has increased steadily, not only in children but also in adolescents and adults, indicating both insufficient herd immunity and vaccine coverage. Waning immunity in the host and/or adaptation of the bacterium to the immunised hosts could contribute to the observed re-emergence of pertussis. In this study we therefore addressed the genetic variability in B. pertussis strains from several Austrian cities. Between the years 2002 and 2008, 110 samples were collected from Vienna (n = 32), Linz (n = 63) and Graz (n = 15) by nasopharyngeal swabs. DNA was extracted from the swabs, and bacterial sequence polymorphisms were examined by MLVA (multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeat analysis) (n = 77), by PCR amplification and conventional Sanger sequencing of the polymorphic regions of the prn (pertactin) gene (n = 110), and by amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (ARMS-qPCR) (n = 110) to directly address polymorphisms in the genes encoding two pertussis toxin subunits (ptxA and ptxB), a fimbrial adhesin (fimD), tracheal colonisation factor (tcfA), and the virulence sensor protein (bvgS). Finally, the ptxP promoter region was screened by ARMS-qPCR for the presence of the ptxP3 allele, which has been associated with elevated production of pertussis toxin. The MLVA analysis revealed the highest level of polymorphisms with an absence of MLVA Type 29, which is found outside Austria. Only Prn subtypes Prn1/7, Prn2 and Prn3 were found with a predominance of the non-vaccine type Prn2. The analysis of the ptxA, ptxB, fimD, tcfA and bvgS polymorphisms showed a genotype mixed between the vaccine strain Tohama I and a clinical isolate from 2006 (L517). The major part of the samples (93\%) displayed the ptxP3 allele. The consequences for the vaccination strategy are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) protects against key serotypes that increased after routine immunisation with the seven-valent vaccine (PCV7), but its potential for herd protection and serotype replacement is uncertain. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales 4 years after its introduction.
METHODS: We used a national dataset of electronically reported and serotyped invasive pneumococcal disease cases in England and Wales to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for vaccine and non-vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease between July, 2013, and June, 2014, versus the pre-PCV13 and pre-PCV7 baseline. Incidence rates were corrected for missing serotype data and changes in surveillance sensitivity over time. An over-dispersed Poisson model was used to estimate IRRs and confidence intervals.
FINDINGS: Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the epidemiological year 2013/14 decreased by 32\% compared with the pre-PCV13 baseline (incidence 10·14 per 100,000 in 2008-10 vs 6·85 per 100,000 in 2013/14; IRR 0·68, 95\% CI 0·64-0·72). This was due to an 86\% reduction of the serotypes covered by PCV7 (1·46 vs 0·20 per 100,000; IRR 0·14, 0·10-0·18) and a 69\% reduction of the additional six serotypes covered by PCV13 (4·48 vs 1·40 per 100,000; IRR 0·31, 0·28-0·35). When compared with the pre-PCV7 baseline, there was a 56\% overall reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (15·63 vs 6·85 per 100,000; IRR 0·44, 95\% CI 0·43-0·47). Compared with the pre-PCV13 baseline, the incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes increased (incidence all ages 4·19 vs 5·25 per 100,000; IRR 1·25, 95\% CI 1·17-1·35) due to increases across a broad range of serotypes in children younger than 5 years and in people aged 45 years or more. In children younger than 5 years, incidence of non-PCV13 serotypes in 2013/14 was higher than in 2012/13 (age {$<$}2 years: 12·03 vs 10·83 per 100,000; age 2-4 years: 4·08 vs 3·63 per 100,000).
INTERPRETATION: 8 years of PCV use in England and Wales has reduced the overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease by more than 50\%. The herd protection induced by PCV7 is continuing, and similar indirect protection is occurring from the additional serotypes covered by PCV13. There is, however, evidence of increasing invasive pneumococcal disease due to non-PCV13 serotypes, particularly in children younger than 5 years in 2014. If this increase continues, the maximum benefit of the PCV13 programme in children might already have been achieved.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is a daunting task to discontinue pertussis completely in China owing to its growing increase in the incidence. While basic to any formulation of prevention and control measures is early response for future epidemic trends. Discrete wavelet transform(DWT) has been emerged as a powerful tool in decomposing time series into different constituents, which facilitates better improvement in prediction accuracy. Thus we aim to integrate modeling approaches as a decision-making supportive tool for formulating health resources.
METHODS: We constructed a novel hybrid method based on the pertussis morbidity cases from January 2004 to May 2018 in China, where the approximations and details decomposed by DWT were forecasted by a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive network (NAR), respectively. Then, the obtained values were aggregated as the final results predicted by the combined model. Finally, the performance was compared with the SARIMA, NAR and traditional SARIMA-NAR techniques.
RESULTS: The hybrid technique at level 2 of db2 wavelet including a SARIMA(0,1,3)(1,0,0)12modelfor the approximation-forecasting and NAR model with 12 hidden units and 4 delays for the detail d1-forecasting, along with another NAR model with 11 hidden units and 5 delays for the detail d2-forecasting notably outperformed other wavelets, SARIMA, NAR and traditional SARIMA-NAR techniques in terms of the mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. Descriptive statistics exhibited that a substantial rise was observed in the notifications from 2013 to 2018, and there was an apparent seasonality with summer peak. Moreover, the trend was projected to continue upwards in the near future.
CONCLUSIONS: This hybrid approach has an outstanding ability to improve the prediction accuracy relative to the others, which can be of great help in the prevention of pertussis. Besides, under current trend of pertussis morbidity, it is required to urgently address strategically within the proper policy adopted.},

Pertussis rates in the United States have been rising and reached a 50-y high of 42,000 cases in 2012. Although pertussis resurgence is not completely understood, we hypothesize that current acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines fail to prevent colonization and transmission. To test our hypothesis, infant baboons were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 mo of age with aP or whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines and challenged with B. pertussis at 7 mo. Infection was followed by quantifying colonization in nasopharyngeal washes and monitoring leukocytosis and symptoms. Baboons vaccinated with aP were protected from severe pertussis-associated symptoms but not from colonization, did not clear the infection faster than naïve animals, and readily transmitted B. pertussis to unvaccinated contacts. Vaccination with wP induced a more rapid clearance compared with naïve and aP-vaccinated animals. By comparison, previously infected animals were not colonized upon secondary infection. Although all vaccinated and previously infected animals had robust serum antibody responses, we found key differences in T-cell immunity. Previously infected animals and wP-vaccinated animals possess strong B. pertussis-specific T helper 17 (Th17) memory and Th1 memory, whereas aP vaccination induced a Th1/Th2 response instead. The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines.},

OBJECTIVE: To reduce infection rates after cesarean section by optimizing systems of obstetric care for low-income women in Colombia by means of quality improvement methods.
METHODS: Multidisciplinary teams in 2 hospitals used simple methods to improve their systems for prescribing and administering perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Process indicators were the percentage of women in whom prophylaxis was administered and the percentage of these women in whom it was administered in a timely fashion. The outcome indicator was the surgical site infection rate.
RESULTS: Before improvement, prophylaxis was administered to 71\% of women in hospital A; 24\% received prophylaxis in a timely fashion. Corresponding figures in hospital B were 36\% and 50\%. Systems improvements included implementing protocols to administer prophylaxis to all women and increasing the availability of the antibiotic in the operating room. These improvements were associated with increases in overall and timely administration of prophylaxis (P{$<$}.001) in both hospitals by time series analysis, with adjustment for volume and case mix. After improvement, overall and timely administration of prophylaxis was 95\% and 96\% in hospital A and 89\% and 96\% in hospital B. In hospital A, the surgical site infection rate decreased immediately after the improvements (P{$<$}.001). In hospital B, the infection rate began a downward trend before the improvements that continued after their implementation (P =.04).
CONCLUSION: Simple quality improvement methods can be used to optimize obstetric services and improve outcomes of care in resource-limited settings.},

  abstract = {Vaccination with heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has significantly reduced the burden of pneumococcal disease and has had an important public health benefit. Because this vaccine targets only seven of the more than 92 pneumococcal serotypes, concerns have been raised that non-vaccine serotypes (NVTs) could increase in prevalence and reduce the benefits of vaccination. Indeed, among asymptomatic carriers, the prevalence of NVTs has increased substantially, and consequently, there has been little or no net change in the bacterial carriage prevalence. In many populations, pneumococcal disease caused by NVT has increased, but in most cases this increase has been less than the increase in NVT carriage. We review the evidence for serotype replacement in carriage and disease, and address the surveillance biases that might affect these findings. We then discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between near-complete replacement in carriage and partial replacement for disease, including differences in invasiveness between vaccine serotypes. We contend that the magnitude of serotype replacement in disease can be attributed, in part, to a combination of lower invasiveness of the replacing serotypes, biases in the pre-vaccine carriage data (unmasking), and biases in the disease surveillance systems that could underestimate the true amount of replacement. We conclude by discussing the future potential for serotype replacement in disease and the need for continuing surveillance.},

Waning of vaccine-induced immunity has been cited as one of the reasons for the observed epidemiologic trend. A review of the published data on duration of immunity reveals estimates that infection-acquired immunity against pertussis disease wanes after 4-20 years and protective immunity after vaccination wanes after 4-12 years. Further research into the rate of waning of vaccine-acquired immunity will help determine the optimal timing and frequency of booster immunizations and their role in pertussis control.},

RESULTS: In July 1995, there were 514 heat-related deaths and 696 excess deaths. People 65 years of age or older were overrepresented and Hispanic people underrepresented. During the most intense heat (July 14 through 20), there were 485 heat-related deaths and 739 excess deaths.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in the USA, many children were vaccinated on schedules that differed from those tested in clinical trials. Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine against various pneumococcal serotypes, and to measure the effectiveness of the recommended dose schedule and of catch-up and incomplete schedules.
METHODS: Invasive disease, defined as isolation of pneumococcus from a sterile site, was identified in children aged 3-59 months through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Active Bacterial Core surveillance. We tested isolates for serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility. Three controls, matched for age and zip code were selected for each case. We calculated the matched odds ratio for vaccination using conditional logistic regression, controlling for underlying conditions. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as one minus the adjusted matched odds ratio times 100\%.
FINDINGS: We enrolled 782 cases and 2512 controls. Effectiveness of one or more doses against vaccine serotypes was 96\% (95\% CI 93-98) in healthy children and 81\% (57-92) in those with coexisting disorders. It was 76\% (63-85) against infections that were not susceptible to penicillin. Vaccination prevented disease caused by all seven vaccine serotypes, and by vaccine-related serotype 6A. Several schedules were more protective than no vaccination; three infant doses with a booster were more protective against vaccine-type disease than were three infant doses alone (p=0.0323).
INTERPRETATION: The seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine prevents invasive disease in both healthy and chronically ill children. The vaccine is effective when used with various non-standard schedules.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia although infection by some serogroups may be prevented through vaccination. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of IMD in EU/EEA countries during 2004-2014 to monitor serogroup- and age-specific trends, and compare country trends by the period of meningococcal C conjugate (MCC) vaccine introduction.
METHODS: We analysed IMD surveillance data by age, gender, serogroup, country and outcome. We estimated the percentage change in annual notification rate (NR), using linear regression analysis of the log of the annual NR. We grouped countries by the year they introduced MCC vaccination into their routine immunisation programmes.
RESULTS: The overall NR was 0.9/100 000 population, and decreased 6.6\% (95\%CI: -8.0\%;-5.1\%) annually. Infants had the highest NR (16.0/100 000), and there were decreasing trends in all age groups {$<$}50years. Serogroup B (SgB) caused 74\% of all cases, and the majority of cases in all age groups. There were decreasing trends in SgB and serogroup C (SgC) and an increasing trend in serogroup Y. Countries that introduced MCC vaccination before, and between 2004 and 2014, had decreasing trends in NR of SgC, but not countries without routine MCC vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support evidence that routine MCC vaccination was the driving force behind the decreasing SgC trend. Vaccinating against SgB in the first year of life could help reduce the burden of IMD due to this serogroup. Changing serogroup-specific NR trends highlight the need for high-quality surveillance data to accurately assess the changing epidemiology of IMD, the effectiveness and impact of implemented vaccines, and the need for future vaccines.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Commercial sex is licensed in Victoria, Australia such that sex workers are required to have regular tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the incidence and prevalence of STIs in sex workers are very low, especially since there is almost universal condom use at work. We aimed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the financial cost of the testing policy versus the health benefits of averting the transmission of HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea to clients. METHODS: We developed a simple mathematical transmission model, informed by conservative parameter estimates from all available data, linked to a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: We estimated that under current testing rates, it costs over \$A90,000 in screening costs for every chlamydia infection averted (and \$A600,000 in screening costs for each quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved) and over \$A4,000,000 for every HIV infection averted (\$A10,000,000 in screening costs for each QALY saved). At an assumed willingness to pay of \$A50,000 per QALY gained, HIV testing should not be conducted less than approximately every 40 weeks and chlamydia testing approximately once per year; in comparison, current requirements are testing every 12 weeks for HIV and every 4 weeks for chlamydia. CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory screening of female sex workers at current testing frequencies is not cost-effective for the prevention of disease in their male clients. The current testing rate required of sex workers in Victoria is excessive. Screening intervals for sex workers should be based on local STI epidemiology and not locked by legislation.},

However, to date there has been no meta-analysis of current literature relating to the effects of temperature fluctuations upon mortality amongst the elderly. We synthesised risk estimates of the overall impact of daily mean temperature on elderly mortality across different continents. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and PubMed to identify papers published up to December 2010. Selection criteria including suitable temperature indicators, endpoints, study-designs and identification of threshold were used. A two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model was performed to summarise the percent increase in mortality with a 1°C temperature increase (or decrease) with 95\% confidence intervals in hot (or cold) days, with lagged effects also measured. Fifteen studies met the eligibility criteria and almost 13 million elderly deaths were included in this meta-analysis. In total, there was a 2-5\% increase for a 1°C increment during hot temperature intervals, and a 1-2 \% increase in all-cause mortality for a 1°C decrease during cold temperature intervals. Lags of up to 9 days in exposure to cold temperature intervals were substantially associated with all-cause mortality, but no substantial lagged effects were observed for hot intervals. Thus, both hot and cold temperatures substantially increased mortality among the elderly, but the magnitude of heat-related effects seemed to be larger than that of cold effects within a global context.},

By utilizing the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and Exponential Smoothing (ETS) model as alterative models with R software, this paper analyzed data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) between January 2005 and June 2016. The ARIMA (0,1,0)(1,1,1)12 model (AICc\,=\,1342.2 BIC\,=\,1350.3) was selected as the best performing ARIMA model and the ETS (M,N,M) model (AICc\,=\,1678.6, BIC\,=\,1715.4) was selected as the best performing ETS model, and the ETS (M,N,M) model with the minimum RMSE was finally selected for in-sample-simulation and out-of-sample forecasting. Descriptive statistics showed that the reported number of pertussis cases by China CDC increased by 66.20\% from 2005 (4058 cases) to 2015 (6744 cases).

In out of sample forecasting, the model forecasted a relatively high incidence cases in 2016, which predicates an increasing risk of ongoing pertussis resurgence in the near future. In this regard, the ETS model would be a useful tool in simulating and forecasting the incidence of pertussis, and helping decision makers to take efficient decisions based on the advanced warning of disease incidence.},

  abstract = {Objective
Interrupted time series is a strong quasi-experimental research design that is increasingly applied to estimate the effects of health services and policy interventions. We describe and illustrate two methods for estimating confidence intervals around absolute and relative changes in outcomes calculated from segmented regression parameter estimates.

Study Design and Setting
We used multivariate delta and bootstrapping methods to construct confidence intervals around relative changes in level and trend and around absolute changes in outcome based on segmented linear regression analyses of time series data corrected for auto-correlated errors.

Results
Using previously published time series data, we estimated confidence intervals around the effect of prescription alerts for interacting medications with warfarin on the rate of prescriptions per 10,000 warfarin users per month. Both the multivariate delta method and the bootstrapping method produced similar results.

Conclusion
The bootstrapping method is preferred for calculating confidence intervals of relative changes in outcomes of time series studies since it does not require large sample sizes when parameter estimates are obtained correctly from the model. Caution is needed when sample size is small.},

Cloud-freeLandsat TM data acquired on 30 June 2002 and 17 July 2009 were selected to generate LSTmaps. Analysis of the SUHI characteristics from these two images reveals that1) there was a mean LST growth in magnitude of 0.63 °C, or 2.09\%. 2) The center of Xining did not exhibit the highest LST. But apart from the arid and semi-arid areas, the spatial pattern of the SUHI shows that higher temperatures in urban than in rural areas.3) The strong negative correlations were found between LST and NDVI. Based on the findings, potential design strategies are proposed in an effort to mitigate SUHI effect.},

  abstract = {This study aims to use big data (climate data, internet query data and school calendar patterns (SCP)) to improve pertussis surveillance and prediction, and develop an early warning model for pertussis epidemics. We collected weekly pertussis notifications, SCP, climate and internet search query data (Baidu index (BI)) in Jinan, China between 2013 and 2017. Time series decomposition and temporal risk assessment were used for examining the epidemic features in pertussis infections. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and regression tree model were developed to predict pertussis occurrence using identified predictors. Our study demonstrates clear seasonal patterns in pertussis epidemics, and pertussis activity was most significantly associated with BI at 2-week lag (rBI = 0.73, p {$<$} 0.05), temperature at 1-week lag (rtemp = 0.19, p {$<$} 0.05) and rainfall at 2-week lag (rrainfall = 0.27, p {$<$} 0.05). No obvious relationship between pertussis peaks and school attendance was found in the study. Pertussis cases were more likely to be temporally concentrated throughout the epidemics during the study period. SARIMA models with 2-week-lagged BI and 1-week-lagged temperature had better predictive performance (βsearch query = 0.06, p = 0.02; βtemp = 0.16, p = 0.03) with large correlation coefficients (r = 0.67, p {$<$} 0.01) and low root mean squared error (RMSE) value (r = 3.59). The regression tree model identified threshold values of potential predictors (search query, climate and SCP) for pertussis epidemics. Our results showed that internet query in conjunction with social and climatic data can predict pertussis epidemics, which is a foundation of using such data to develop early warning systems.},

	abstract = {Introduction Increased transmissibility of B.1.17 variant of concern (VOC) in the UK may explain its rapid emergence and global spread. We analysed data from putative household infector - infectee pairs in the Virus Watch Community cohort study to assess the serial interval of COVID-19 and whether this was affected by emergence of the B.1.17 variant.Methods The Virus Watch study is an online, prospective, community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Putative household infector-infectee pairs were identified where more than one person in the household had a positive swab matched to an illness episode. Data on whether individual infections were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant were not available. We therefore developed a classification system based on the percentage of cases estimated to be due to B.1.17 in national surveillance data for different English regions and study weeks.Results Out of 24,887 illnesses reported, 915 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 186 likely infector-infectee pairs in 186 households amongst 372 individuals were identified. The mean COVID-19 serial interval was 3.18 (95\%CI: 2.55 - 3.81) days. There was no significant difference (p=0.267) between the mean serial interval for Variants of Concern (VOC) hotspots (mean = 3.64 days, (95\%CI: 2.55 {\textendash} 4.73)) days and non-VOC hotspots, (mean = 2.72 days, (95\%CI: 1.48 {\textendash} 3.96)).Conclusions Our estimates of the average serial interval of COVID-19 are broadly similar to estimates from previous studies and we find no evidence that B.1.1.7 is associated with a change in serial intervals. Alternative explanations such as increased viral load, longer period of viral shedding or improved receptor binding may instead explain the increased transmissibility and rapid spread and should undergo further investigation.Competing Interest StatementACH serves on the UK New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group.
